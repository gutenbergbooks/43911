<span class="i0">"Hear the mellow wedding-bells&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i3">What a world of happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their melody foretells!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>"Hark! there's the wedding-march."</p>

<p>"Here they come!"</p>

<p>"Looks as white as a corpse, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; as beautiful as a dream, to my notion. Pallor
is becoming in brides, you know."</p>

<p>"He's a silly old dotard, though, not to know that she's
taking him for his money."</p>

<p>"Of course he knows it. I dare say the old gray-beard
is glad he had money enough to buy so much youth and
loveliness."</p>

<p>"What a splendid veil and dress! They say her rich
aunt furnished the <i>trousseau</i>."</p>

<p>"Her jewels are magnificent."</p>

<p>"The bridegroom's gift, of course. Well, he is able to
cover her with diamonds."</p>

<p>These were but few of the remarks that were whispered
in the fashionable throng gathered at Trinity to witness a
marriage in high life&mdash;a marriage that was all the more interesting
from the fact that the contracting parties were so
totally dissimilar to each other that the whole affair in the
eyes of the outsiders resolved itself into a simple matter of
bargain and sale&mdash;so much youth and beauty for an old
man's gold.</p>

<p>The bridegroom was John St. John, a millionaire of high
birth and standing in the city where he lived, but so old
and infirm that people said of him that "he had one foot
in the grave and the other on the brink of it," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
bride was the young daughter of some obscure country
people.</p>

<p>An aunt in the city had given her some advantages, and
kept her in town two seasons, hoping to bring about a good
match for her, since she had no dowry of her own, save
youth, talent and peerless beauty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what is your fortune, my pretty maid?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My face is my fortune, sir," she said.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Xenie Carroll was fulfilling her aunt's ambitious
hopes and desires to their uttermost limit as she walked up
the broad aisle of Trinity that night, clothed in her bridal
white, and leaning on the arm of the decrepit old millionaire,
John St. John.</p>

<p>His form was bent with age, his hair and beard were
white, his eyes were dim and bleared; and she was in the
bloom of youth and beauty. It was the union of winter and
summer.</p>

<p>They passed slowly up the aisle to the grand music of
the wedding-march, and after them came fair maidens,
robed in white and adorned with flowers and jewels.</p>

<p>These stood round about the pair at the altar who were
taking upon their lips the sacred vow of marriage.</p>

<p>It was over.</p>

<p>The holy man of God lifted reverent hands and invoked
God's blessing upon this sordid bargain that desecrated the
holy rite of marriage, the ring was slipped over the bride's
white finger, and Xenie Carroll turned away from the altar
Mrs. John St. John, mistress of the handsomest house in the
city and the most princely private fortune.</p>

<p>There was a flash of triumph in her dark eyes as she received
the congratulations of her friends, yet her cheeks
and lips were cold and white as marble.</p>

<p>But the light and color came back to her beautiful face
when, in the same carriage that had taken her from her
aunt's roof a poor, dependent girl, she was whirled back to
the millionaire's splendid home to take her place as its
queen.</p>

<p>The aged bridegroom scarcely felt equal to an extended
bridal tour, so he had wisely eschewed a trip, and determined
to inaugurate the reign of the new social star by a
brilliant reception at his splendid residence.</p>

<p>All the beauties of art and nature were called in to further
his design.</p>

<p>The elegant drawing-rooms were almost transformed into
bowers of tropical bloom.</p>

<p>Beautiful birds fluttered their tropical plumage and caroled
their sweet songs in the gilded cages that swung in
the flowery arches and niches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Music filled the air with entrancing strains, wooing light
feet to the giddy dance.</p>

<p>In the spacious supper-room the tables shone with silver
and gold and crystal, and every delicacy that could tempt
the appetite from home or foreign shores was daintily served
for the wedding-guests, with wines of the purest vintage
and greatest age.</p>

<p>There was no lack of wealth, there was no lack of beauty
in the brilliant assemblage that graced the millionaire's
proud house that night; and she, his bride, was now the
wealthiest, as she had ever been the loveliest, of them all,
yet she stole away at length from her aged bridegroom's
flatteries, and sought the solitude of the conservatory.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>The beautiful fragrance-breathing bower was deserted.
The soft light of the wax-lights, half-hidden in flowers,
streamed down upon her as she trod the leafy walks alone
in her beautiful white satin robe, frosted with delicate lace,
and her shining jewels that encircled a throat as white and
round and queenly as if she had been a princess royal.</p>

<p>Yet none were here to praise the soft light of her dark
eyes, the dazzling beauty of her smiles, the tender, tinted
oval of her face.</p>

<p>Why was she here alone to "waste her sweetness on the
desert air?"</p>

<p>Ah! in a moment she spoke in a stifled voice, her white
hands twisted in the band of jewels that encircled her throat
as if the beautiful flashing things burned her by their mere
contact.</p>

<p>"I had to come here for a free breath away from that old
man whose very presence stifles and smothers me. And
yet&mdash;and yet, I am his wife! Oh, Heaven, what a terrible
price I must pay for my revenge!"</p>

<p>She paused, and a strange look came into her eyes. It
was a look of terrible dread and despair, inexplicably blended
with passionate triumph.</p>

<p>"And yet," she began again, after a moment's silence,
looking around at the evidences of wealth and taste so lavishly
scattered about her, "what a glorious revenge it is! It
was for this he scorned and deserted me! Yet I have stripped
him of his heritage. I have stolen from him the empire he
held so long. I have revenged myself tenfold for what I
suffered at his hands. Ah! weak fool that I am, why regret
the price of such a splendid triumph?"</p>

<p>Her face grew hard and cold, a cruel smile curled her
scarlet lips, her eyes flashed with scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Pride and passion spoke in every curve of her mobile,
spirited face.</p>

<p>The lace hangings at the entrance parted noiselessly, and
a man stepped lightly across the threshold.</p>

<p>Not a sound announced his presence, yet she looked up
instantly, as if by some subtle inner sense she divined that
he was there.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she breathed, in a hissing tone of hate and scorn.</p>

<p>A mocking smile curled the man's lip as he bowed before
her.</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>ma tante</i>," he said, in a cool tone of scorn, "permit
me to offer my congratulations."</p>

<p>Some emotion too great for utterance seemed to overpower
her, so that she struggled vainly for speech a moment,
while he stood silent, with folded arms, looking down
at her from his haughty height with a look of veiled hatred
in his dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p>They were deadly foes, this man and woman, yet nature
had formed them as if for the perfect complement of each
other.</p>

<p>He was tall, strong and fair, with the proud beauty and
commanding air we fancy in the Grecian gods of old.</p>

<p>She was <i>petite</i>, dark, brilliant as a rose, and passionate as
the tropical blood of the south could make her.</p>

<p>Breaking down the bars of her great emotion at last, she
laughed aloud&mdash;a cool, insolent, incredulous laugh that
made the hot blood bound faster through his veins, and a
flush creep over his face.</p>

<p>"You call me aunt," she said; "ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, you bear that relationship to me since
your marriage with my uncle," he answered, with a formal
bow.</p>

<p>"You expect to find me a most loving relative, no doubt?"
she said, with exasperating coolness.</p>

<p>"I hope to do so, at least," he said, with calm frankness,
"I cannot afford to quarrel with my uncle. I shall hope
to keep on good terms with his wife."</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't wish to quarrel with your bread and butter,"
she said in a tone of cool contempt. "Well, <i>mon ami</i>,
what do you suppose I married your uncle for?"</p>

<p>"The world says that you married him for his money,"
said the handsome young man, coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what the world says," she answered, with
flashing eyes, and cresting her graceful head as haughtily
as a young stag. "But you, Howard Templeton, you know
better than that."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, how should I know better?" he rejoined,
watching her keenly, as if it gave him a certain pleasure
to irritate her. "The money seems to me the only reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
excuse you had for taking him. My uncle, kindly be
it spoken, for he has been my kindest friend, is neither
young nor handsome. I credited you with better taste
than to love such a homely old man!"</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, writhing under the keen sting
of his words; "I did not marry him for love! Neither did
I marry him for his money. I have never craved
wealth for its own sake, though I have always known that
a costly setting would befit beauty such as mine. I sold
myself to that old man in yonder for revenge!"</p>

<p>"Revenge?" he repeated, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, upon <i>you</i>!" she repeated, with bitter frankness;
"you sacrificed me that you might inherit your uncle's
wealth. Love, hope, gladness, were stricken from my life
at one fell blow. There was nothing left me but revenge
upon my base deceiver. So I sold myself for the heritage
you prized so highly that you might be left penniless."</p>

<p>"Yet once you loved me!" he muttered, half to himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, once I loved you," she answered, looking at him
in proud scorn. "When my aunt brought me to the city
two years ago a simple, unsophisticated country girl, you
saw me and set yourself to win me by every art of which
you were master. She encouraged you in your designs,
for she knew that you were the reputed heir of your uncle,
John St. John, and she thought it would be a fine match
for the pretty little country girl. In the spring I went
home with your ring upon my finger, the proudest girl in
the world, and told mamma that you had promised to
marry me. Then you came down to my country home and
found out that the rich Mrs. Egerton's pretty niece was as
poor as a church mouse. So you went back and told John
St. John that you wanted to marry a girl who was beautiful
but poor, and he&mdash;the old dotard, who had forgotten
his youth, and transmuted his heart into gold&mdash;he bade
you give me up on pain of disinheritance."</p>

<p>"And I obeyed him," said Howard Templeton, as she
paused for breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, you obeyed him," she repeated; "you broke your
plighted faith and word, you ruined my life, you broke my
heart, you sold your truth and your honor to that cruel old
man for his sordid gold, and now, to-night, you stand
stripped of everything&mdash;and all because you turned a
woman's love to hate."</p>

<p>She paused breathlessly and stood looking at him with
blazing eyes and crimson cheeks, and lips parted in a smile
of bitter triumph.</p>

<p>She had never looked more beautiful, yet it was a dangerous
beauty, scathing to the man who looked upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and knew that his sin had roused the terrible passions of
revenge and hatred in her young heart.</p>

<p>"But Xenie, think a moment," he said. "I had been
brought up by Uncle John as his heir. I did not know how
to work. I never earned a cent in my whole life! When
he swore he would disinherit me if I married you, what
could I do? I had to give you up. You must have starved
if I had married you against his will!"</p>

<p>"I would have starved with you, I loved you so!" she
exclaimed passionately.</p>

<p>"Would you, really?" he asked, with a slight air of wonder;
"well, they say that women love like that. For myself,
I have never reached a stage as idiotic, though I own
that I loved you to the verge of distraction, Xenie."</p>

<p>"Well, and what will you do now?" she asked, sneeringly.
"You will have to starve at last without the pleasure
of my company, for my husband shall never leave you one
dollar of his money; I will poison his mind against you, I
will make him hate you even as I hate you! I have sworn
to have the bitterest revenge for my wrongs, and I will
surely keep my vow!"</p>

<p>"I defy you," he answered, looking down at her from
his superb height, his proud Saxon beauty ablaze with wrath
and scorn. "I defy you to rob me of my uncle's heart or
even of his fortune. He shall know what a traitress he has
taken to his heart. I will dispute your empire with you
and you shall find me a foeman worthy of your steel. You
will find that it is a terrible thing to make a man who has
loved you hate and defy you!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The sweetest thing upon this earth is love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And next to love, the sweetest thing is hate.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She quoted with a wild, defiant laugh. "Well, Howard
Templeton, I take up the gage of defiance that you have
thrown down. We will wage the deadliest feud the world
ever knew between man and woman! From this moment
it shall be war to the knife!"</p>

<p>"So be it," he answered with a scowl of hatred as he
turned upon his heel and passed through the lace hangings
to mingle with the gay and thoughtless throng outside, while
curious glances followed him on every side, for all knew
that the foolish old bridegroom had promised to make
Howard Templeton his heir.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The beautiful bride remained motionless where Howard
Templeton had left her until the rich lace curtains parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
noiselessly again and her lawful lord and master looked in
upon her.</p>

<p>He did not speak for a moment, so beautiful she looked
standing still and pale as a statue beneath a tall rose-tree
that showered its scented petals down upon her night-black
hair with its crown of orange blossoms.</p>

<p>No subtle instinct warned her of his presence as it had
when that other came.</p>

<p>She stood silent and pale, the dark lashes shading her
rounded cheek, her white hands loosely clasped before her
until he spoke:</p>

<p>"Xenie, my darling!"</p>

<p>She started and shivered as she looked up.</p>

<p>Mr. St. John came slowly to her side and drew her hand
through his arm.</p>

<p>"My dear, I have been seeking you everywhere. Supper
is announced," he said.</p>

<p>"I only came here just a little while ago for a quiet minute
to myself," she said, apologetically.</p>

<p>"Ah! then, you like quiet and repose sometimes," he said;
"I am glad of that, for I am not fond of gayety myself, at
least not too much of it. I suppose I am getting too far into
the sere and yellow leaf to enjoy it, eh, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I hope not; sir," she said, making an effort to throw off
her preoccupation and enter into the conversation with interest.</p>

<p>After the splendid banquet had been served, he led her to
a quiet seat and begged her not to dance again that evening.</p>

<p>"I am too old to dance myself," he said, "but I am so
selfish I want to keep you by my side that I may feast my
eyes upon your peerless beauty. Can you be contented
with my society, love?" he inquired, giving her a curious
look.</p>

<p>"I will do whatever pleases you best, sir," she said, with
an inward shudder of disgust.</p>

<p>"Very well; we will sit here hand in hand like a veritable
Darby and Joan, and enjoy each other's company," he said,
giving her an affectionate smile.</p>

<p>The bride looked at her lord in surprise. She had not
known him long, for their marriage had followed upon a
brief acquaintance and hurried courtship.</p>

<p>Xenie had never thought him very brilliant, and, indeed,
she had heard people say maliciously that the old man was
getting weak-minded, but after all, the proposition to hold
her hand before all that brilliant array of wedding-guests
nearly staggered her.</p>

<p>She made some plausible excuse for keeping her hands in
her own possession, and sat quietly by his side, watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the black coats of the men and the bright robes of the women
as they fluttered through the joyous mazes of the
dance.</p>

<p>"Do you see the lovely girl dancing with my nephew,
Howard Templeton?" he said, to her after a short silence.</p>

<p>She looked up and saw Edith Wayland, one of her bridesmaids,
whirling through the waltz in the arms of her deadly
foe.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with a kind of stifled gasp.</p>

<p>"She's in love with my nephew," said the old man, with
a low chuckle of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Indeed? Did she tell you so?" asked Mrs. St. John, half
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Never mind how I found out. It's true, anyhow. And
she is a great heiress, my dear, almost as rich as I am. I
mean to make a match between her and my nephew."</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked, but her voice was very low and
faint, and the room swam around her so that the dancers
seemed mingled in inextricable mazes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; but what is the matter with you, my darling?"
he said, looking anxiously at her. "You have grown so
pale!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing&mdash;a headache from the heat of the rooms,"
she murmured, confusedly, "but go on. You were saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I am going to marry my nephew to Miss Wayland&mdash;yes.
She is very rich, and he, well, the poor fellow, you
know, Xenie, always expected to be my heir. And now,
since my marriage, of course his prospects are entirely altered.
He cannot expect much from me now. But I'm going
to set him up with a few thousands, and marry him to
the heiress. That's almost as well as leaving him my money&mdash;isn't
it?" he laughed. "I've spoken to Howard about it,
and he is pleased with the idea. There will be no difficulty
with her, I am sure. Howard was always a lucky dog
among the girls."</p>

<p>He laughed, and rubbed his withered palms softly together,
and Xenie sat perfectly silent, her brain in a whirl,
her pulse beating at fever heat.</p>

<p>Was this old man, whom she hated because his despotic
will had blasted her brief dream of happiness, to despoil
her of her revenge for which she had dared and risked so
much?</p>

<p>And Howard Templeton&mdash;was her oath of vengeance of
no avail, that fortune should make him her spoiled darling
still?</p>

<p>The waltz music ceased with a great, passionate crash of
melody, and the gentlemen led their partners to their
seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. St. John resigned his seat to Edith Wayland, and
moved away on the arm of his nephew.</p>

<p>"What a handsome man Mr. Templeton is," said the
lovely girl shyly to Mrs. St. John.</p>

<p>The bride looked after his retreating figure with a curl of
her scarlet lip.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is as handsome as a Greek god," she said, "but
then, he is utterly heartless&mdash;a mere fortune-hunter."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. St. John, surely not," said Miss Wayland, in
an anxious tone. "Why should you think so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would suit you as well not to hear," said
Mrs. St. John, with an arch insinuation in her look and
tone.</p>

<p>"By no means. Pray tell me your reasons for what you
said, Mrs. St. John," said the sweet, blue-eyed girl, blushing
very much, and nervously fluttering her white satin
fan.</p>

<p>"Well, since you are not particularly interested in him,
I will tell you," was the careless reply. "I was engaged
to Mr. Templeton myself, two winters ago&mdash;when I first
came out, you know, dear! I suppose he thought I was
wealthy, for Aunt Egerton dressed me elegantly, and lent
me her diamonds. The summer after our engagement he
came to the country to see me, and then he found out my
poverty&mdash;for I will tell you candidly, Edith, my people are as
poor as church mice&mdash;and, would you believe it? he went
back and wrote me a letter, and told me he could not afford
to marry for love&mdash;he must have an heiress or none. So
our little affair was all over with then, you know."</p>

<p>She paused and looked away, for she knew that she had
stabbed the girl's heart deeply, and she did not wish to
witness the pain she had inflicted.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, Miss Wayland exclaimed, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. St. John, is it possible that Mr. Templeton
could have treated you so cruelly and heartlessly?"</p>

<p>"It is quite true, Miss Wayland. If you doubt my word
I give you <i>carte blanche</i> to ask my aunt, Mrs. Egerton, or
even Mr. Templeton himself. You see I have the best
reason in the world for accusing him of being a fortune-hunter."</p>

<p>The beautiful young girl did not think of doubting Mrs.
St. John's assertion, although it caused her the bitterest
pain.</p>

<p>There was an earnestness in the words and tones of the
bride that carried conviction with them.</p>

<p>Miss Wayland sat musing quietly a moment, then she
said, hesitatingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I ask if you are friends with Mr. Templeton now,
Mrs. St. John?"</p>

<p>Xenie lifted her dark eyes and looked at the gentle girl.</p>

<p>"Should you love a man that won your heart and threw
it away like a broken toy?" she asked, slowly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that I could ever forgive him," said
Edith, frankly.</p>

<p>"Nor can I," answered Xenie, in a low voice of repressed
passion. "No, I am not friends with him, Edith, and
never shall be; I am not the kind of woman who could forgive
such a cruel slight."</p>

<p>Neither of them said another word on the subject, but
Edith knew quite well from that moment why Xenie had
married Mr. St. John.</p>

<p>"It was not for the sake of the money, but simply to revenge
herself on Howard Templeton," she said to herself,
with a woman's ready wit.</p>

<p>And when Mr. Templeton, according to his uncle's desire,
offered her his hand and heart, a few days later, expecting
to have her for the asking, he was surprised to receive a
cold, almost contemptuous refusal.</p>

<p>But she dropped a few words before they parted by which
he knew plainly that his deadly foe had been working
against him, and that her revengeful hand had struck a
fortune from his grasp for the second time in the space of a
week.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>Several months of irksome quiet to Mrs. St. John succeeded
the festivities that followed upon her marriage.</p>

<p>Her elderly bridegroom found that protracted gayeties
did not agree with his age and health, and with the obstinacy
common to a selfish old age, he prohibited his wife
from participation in those scenes of pleasure in which, by
reason of her youth and beauty, she was so pre-eminently
fitted to shine.</p>

<p>He could not stand such excitement himself, he said, and
he wanted his wife at home to cheer and solace his declining
years.</p>

<p>So the beautiful bridal dresses hung in the wardrobe unworn,
and the costly jewels hid their brightness locked
away in their caskets.</p>

<p>Xenie had small need for these things in the lonely life
to which she found herself condemned by her foolish, doting
old husband.</p>

<p>Loving pleasure and excitement with all the ardor of a
passionate, impulsive temperament like hers, it is quite
possible that Mrs. St. John might have rebelled against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
liege lord's selfishness, but for one strong purpose to which
she bent every energy, subordinating everything else to its
accomplishment.</p>

<p>So she bore his selfish exactions with a patient, yielding
sweetness, and ministered to his caprices with the beautiful
devotion of a fireside angel.</p>

<p>She was using every sweet persuasion in her power to
induce Mr. St. John to execute a will in her favor.</p>

<p>She had learned that in the event of his death, without a
will, his widow would legally inherit only one-third of his
great wealth, while the remaining two-thirds would descend
to his next of kin&mdash;the next of kin in this case being her enemy,
Howard Templeton.</p>

<p>Xenie knew that her revenge would not be secure until
her husband had made his will and cut off his nephew without
a dollar.</p>

<p>She had believed that Mr. St. John's infatuation for her
would make her task easy, but she had not counted upon
the uneasy sense in the old man's mind of a certain injustice
done to the nephew he had reared, by his unexpected marriage.</p>

<p>"No, no, Xenie," he said, when she openly pleaded with
him to make such a will. "It would be unjust to leave
poor Howard without a dollar to support himself."</p>

<p>"He is a man," said Xenie, scornfully. "He has his head
and hands to earn his living."</p>

<p>"Yes; but Howard does not know how to work, my darling,
and it is all my fault. I brought him up as my heir
and refused to let him have a profession or to learn anything
useful. You see we are the last of our race, and I
expected to leave him everything when I died. I did not
know I should meet and marry you, my darling," he said,
kissing her fondly, without noticing her uncontrollable
shiver of disgust.</p>

<p>"Yes, but your marriage alters everything," she said,
eagerly, lifting her melting, dark eyes to his face with a
siren smile on the curve of her scarlet lips. "You would
not wish to leave your money away from me, your poor,
helpless little wife?"</p>

<p>"There is enough for you both, my dear," he said, persuasively.
"Howard might have his share&mdash;the smaller
share, of course&mdash;and you would still be a wealthy woman!"</p>

<p>"I hate Howard Templeton!" exclaimed Xenie, with sudden,
passionate vehemence.</p>

<p>The old man looked at her half angrily.</p>

<p>"You hate my nephew?" he said. "Why do you hate
him, Xenie, when next to you I love him, best of anyone in
the world?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Xenie's sober senses, that had almost deserted her in her
sudden gust of passion, returned to her with a gasp.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, forgive me," she said, with ready penitence, "I
spoke foolishly. I do not like you to love him so. I am
jealous of you, my darling!"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him and laid her white arm around his
shoulder caressingly.</p>

<p>But suddenly, and even as she lifted her beautiful face
for his caress, he drew back his hand, and without a word
of warning, struck her a heavy blow across the face.</p>

<p>She reeled backward and fell upon the floor, the red blood
spurting from her nostrils and from her lips that the terrible
blow had driven against the points of her white teeth and
terribly lacerated.</p>

<p>"You Jezebel," he shouted, hoarsely, rising and standing
over her with his brandished fist. "How dare you hate
him&mdash;my own nephew, my handsome Howard!"</p>

<p>With a moan of fear and pain Xenie sprang up and fled
to the furthest corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Oh! you coward!" she cried, passionately. "To strike
a woman&mdash;a helpless woman!"</p>

<p>She was trying to staunch the fast flowing blood with her
lace handkerchief, but she stopped and stared at him in
dumb terror as he approached her.</p>

<p>For the glare of madness shone in his dim eyes as they
turned upon her&mdash;his foam-flecked lips were drawn away
from his glistening set of false teeth, and his face presented
a terrible appearance.</p>

<p>"Oh! my God, he is going to kill me!" she moaned to
herself, crouching down in the corner with her arms raised
wildly above her shrinking head.</p>

<p>He towered above her with his clenched fist raised threateningly
and his eyes glaring ferociously upon her.</p>

<p>Xenie believed that a sudden frenzy of madness had come
upon her husband and that he was going to take her life.</p>

<p>She was about to shriek aloud in the hope of rescue, when
he suddenly clapped a strong hand over her lips.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said, fearfully, "hush, Xenie, don't let anyone
know I struck you! Does it hurt you much?&mdash;the blood,
I mean&mdash;I'm sorry if it does."</p>

<p>The tone was that of a wheedling, penitent child that is
sorry for its fault. In sheer surprise the frightened creature
looked up at him.</p>

<p>The ferocious look of bloodthirsty madness had marvelously
faded from his face, and left a pale, fearful, childish
expression instead.</p>

<p>He dropped his hand and wiped the blood from it, shivering
all over.</p>

<p>"Oh! the blood, how red it is!" he whined. "Did I hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
you, my love? I'm sorry&mdash;very sorry. Don't tell anyone
I struck you."</p>

<p>"I'll tell the whole world," she flashed forth, speaking
with difficulty, for her lips were bruised and swollen. "I'll
tell them that you are mad, and I'll have you put into an
asylum for dangerous lunatics, you base coward!"</p>

<p>Mr. St. John's face grew livid at her angry threat. He
trembled with fear.</p>

<p>"No, no, Xenie, you won't, you mustn't do it," he gasped
forth. "I will never do so again. I'll be your slave if
you won't tell!"</p>

<p>"I will tell it everywhere!" cried his young wife, rushing
to the door, her whole passionate spirit aglow with the
keenest resentment.</p>

<p>But with unlooked-for strength in one of his age, he ran
forward, and stood with his back against the door.</p>

<p>"You shall not go till you promise to keep silent," he
said, firmly; "I will do anything you ask me, Xenie, if
you will only not tell on me!"</p>

<p>"Anything?" she exclaimed, turning quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, anything," he reiterated, with a weak, imploring
look, full of craven fear.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered firmly; "make your will to-day,
and cut Howard Templeton off with a shilling, and I'll
keep your secret&mdash;otherwise the city shall ring with the
story of your cruelty!"</p>

<p>"Won't you let me leave him ten thousand dollars, dear?"
he asked, pitifully.</p>

<p>"Not a dollar!" she answered coldly.</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Not a dollar!" she reiterated firmly.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, weakly. "I have said you
shall name your own price. Shall I go to my lawyer now,
Xenie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now," she answered, with a flash of triumph in
her eyes.</p>

<p>He stood still a moment looking at her with a half-insane
look of cunning on the wrinkled features that but a moment
ago had been transformed by maniacal rage.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" he said, "you hate him very much, Xenie;
I wonder what he has done to make you his enemy!"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and the old millionaire went out of
the room, after turning upon her a strange look of blended
cunning and triumph which she could not understand.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! he meant nothing by it," she said to herself to
dispel the uneasy impression that glance had left. "The
old man is getting weak and silly. One is scarcely safe
alone with him."</p>

<p>She shuddered at the recollection of what she had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
through, and going to her private room, locked the door
and bathed her swollen, discolored face with a healing
lotion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>Xenie remained alone in her chamber until darkness
gathered like a pall over every luxurious object about her.
Her maid came and tapped at the door once, but she sent
her away, saying that her head ached and she did not wish
to be disturbed.</p>

<p>It was quite true, for her heavy fall upon the floor had
hurt her severely; so she remained quietly lying on a sofa
until black darkness hid everything from her confused
sight.</p>

<p>Then there came a light tap upon the door again. She
thought it was the maid to light the gas.</p>

<p>"You may go away, Finette, I do not need you yet,"
she said, feeling that the darkness suited her mood the
best.</p>

<p>"It is I, Xenie. Open the door. I wish to speak to
you," said her husband's voice.</p>

<p>She went to the door, unlocked and threw it wide open.
The light from the hall streamed in upon her pale and haggard
face, her dress in disorder, her dark hair loose and
dishevelled.</p>

<p>"It is dark in there, I cannot see you, my darling," he
said; "come across into my smoking-room in the light. I
want to tell you something."</p>

<p>He took her hand and drew her across the hall into a luxurious
apartment he called his smoking-room.</p>

<p>It was elegantly furnished with cushioned easy-chairs
and lounges, while the floor was covered with a soft, Persian
carpet and beautiful rugs.</p>

<p>The marble mantel was decorated with costly meerschaums,
and chibouques of various patterns and materials,
and a richly gilded box stood in the center, containing
cigars and perfumed smoking tobacco.</p>

<p>On a marble-topped table in the center of the room stood
two bottles of wine, and two richly-chased drinking glasses.</p>

<p>"Well?" she inquired, half-fearfully, as he drew her in
and carefully closed the door.</p>

<p>"I have made my will, dear," he said, looking at her
with a curious smile.</p>

<p>"And you have cut Howard Templeton off without a
shilling?" she said, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, I have made you the sole heir to all my
wealth," answered the old man, drawing his arm around
her shrinking form. "But perhaps you will wish the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
man dead, now, that you may enjoy his money without
any incumbrance."</p>

<p>"Oh! no," she exclaimed quickly, for something in his
words touched her heart, and made her forget for a moment
that cruel blow from his hand. "Oh! no, I shall
never wish you dead, and I thank you a thousand times for
your generosity."</p>

<p>"Then you forgive me for my&mdash;for that&mdash;to-day?" he inquired
in a flighty, half-frightened way, fixing his dim
eyes on her beautiful face with an anxious expression.</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgive you freely," she said, touched again, as
she scarcely thought she could be, by his looks and tones,
and yet longing to get away, for she was half-frightened
by a certain inexplicable wildness about him. "And now
I must go and dress for dinner."</p>

<p>"Wait, I have not done with you yet," he said, catching
her tightly around the wrist, his restlessness increasing.
"I saw my nephew on the street, and brought him home
with me to dinner. Do you care, Xenie?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not care," she answered, steadily, yet her heart
gave a great passionate throb of bitter anger.</p>

<p>Still holding her tightly by the hand he pulled open the
door and sent his voice ringing loudly down the hall.</p>

<p>"Howard, Howard, come here!"</p>

<p>Xenie heard the distant door of the library unclose, then
shut again, and a man's footsteps ringing along the marble
hall.</p>

<p>She tried to wrench her hand away and flee, but it was
useless. He held her as in a vise.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she panted, "my hair is down, my dress
is disarranged, my face is disfigured, I do not wish to meet
him."</p>

<p>But he held her tightly, gnashing his teeth in sudden rage
at her efforts to escape.</p>

<p>At that moment Howard Templeton entered the room.</p>

<p>He started back as his gaze encountered Mrs. St. John's,
then with a cold bow stood still, turning an inquiring glance
upon his uncle's excited face.</p>

<p>"I want you to take a glass of wine with me, Howard,"
said his uncle in a cordial tone. "Xenie, my love, you will
pour the wine for us."</p>

<p>He led her forward, to the little marble-topped table
where stood the wine and glasses.</p>

<p>She saw that the corks were both drawn from the bottles,
and taking up one she poured some of its contents into
the richly-chased glass beside it.</p>

<p>"Now pour from the second bottle into the second glass,"
commanded her husband.</p>

<p>Xenie silently obeyed him, without a thought as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
strangeness of the request, for her heart was beating almost
to suffocation with the bitter consciousness of her enemy's
presence.</p>

<p>Mr. St. John watched her every motion with a strange,
repressed excitement.</p>

<p>His eyes glittered, his lips worked as if he were talking
to himself. He nodded to his nephew as she stepped back.</p>

<p>"Let us drink long life and happiness to Mrs. St. John,"
he said.</p>

<p>Howard Templeton took one glass, and his uncle took the
remaining one.</p>

<p>Both bowed to the shrinking woman who stood watching
them, drained their glasses, and set them back with a
simultaneous clink upon the marble table.</p>

<p>Then a wild, maniacal laugh filled the room&mdash;so shrill, so
exultant, so blood-curdling, it froze the blood in the veins
of the man and woman who stood there listening.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," cried Mr. St. John, "you thought I did not
know your secret, you two! But I did. I heard your talk
on my wedding-night. I knew then that I had taken the
woman you loved. Howard, I knew that she had sought
me, and won me, and married me, to revenge her wrongs
at your hands. I said to myself her beautiful body is mine&mdash;I
have bought it with my gold&mdash;but her heart is Howard
Templeton's!"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Xenie, stamping her foot passionately;
"I hate him! I hate him!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" thundered the old man, turning on her with the
wild glare of madness in his eyes, "hush, woman! I have
thought it over for months&mdash;at last I have reached a conclusion.
The world is not wide enough for us two men to
live in. So I said to myself&mdash;one of us must die!"</p>

<p>"Must die!" repeated Howard Templeton, with a sudden
strong shudder.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>die</i>!" cried the maniac, with another horrible laugh.
"So I put deadly poison into one of the bottles that chance
might decide our fates. Xenie poured out death for one of
us just now. In ten minutes either you or I will be dead,
Howard Templeton!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>For one terrible moment Xenie St. John and Howard
Templeton remained silently gazing at the excited old man,
as if petrified with horror, then:</p>

<p>"My God, my uncle is a madman!" broke hoarsely from
the young man's ashen lips, in tones of unutterable horror
and grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. St. John rushed to the door, threw it wide open, and
shrieked aloud in frenzied accents for help.</p>

<p>The servants came rushing in and found their old master
crouching in a corner of the room, gibbering and mouthing
like some terrible wild beast, his bloodshot eyes rolling in
their sockets, his lips all flecked with foam, while Howard
Templeton remained silent in the center of the room, like a
statue of horror.</p>

<p>"A doctor&mdash;bring a doctor!" shrieked Xenie, wildly.</p>

<p>It was not five minutes before a physician, living close
by, was brought in, but even as he crossed the threshold,
the insane creature rolled over upon the floor in the agonies
of death.</p>

<p>One or two desperate struggles, a gasp, a quiver from
head to foot and the old millionaire lay dead before them.</p>

<p>The physician knelt down and felt his heart and his
pulse.</p>

<p>"He is dead," he said, shaking his head slowly and sadly.
"I apprehended a fit the last time he consulted me,
some three weeks ago. His mind and body were both
weakening fast. This mournful end was not unexpected
by me."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John made a quick step forward.</p>

<p>She was about to say, "He did not die in a fit, doctor,
he died of poison," when a hand like steel gripped her
wrist.</p>

<p>She looked up and met the stern, awful gaze of Howard
Templeton.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he whispered, hurriedly and sternly. "Let the
world accept the physician's verdict. Say nothing of what
you know. Do not brand his memory with the terrible obloquy
of insanity and self-murder!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned away, and crossed the room, and
as he passed the marble-topped table, it fell over, no one
could have told how, and the bottles and glasses were shivered
upon the floor.</p>

<p>One of the servants removed the <i>debris</i>, and mopped up
the spilled wine from the floor, and no one thought anything
more of it.</p>

<p>Yet, by that simple act, Howard Templeton saved his
uncle's name and his own from the shafts of malice and calumny
that must have assailed them if the terrible truth had
come to light.</p>

<p>So the physician's hasty verdict of apoplexy was universally
accepted by the world, and the old millionaire was laid
away in his costly tomb a few days later, regretted by all
his friends, and the secret of his tragic death was locked in
the breasts of two who kept that hideous story sacred, although
they were deadly foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, deadly foes, and destined to hate each other more
and more, for when the old millionaire's papers were examined,
the beautiful widow found that she was foiled of her
dearly-bought revenge at last.</p>

<p>For no will was found, although Xenie protested passionately
that her husband had made a will the very last day
of his life.</p>

<p>The most careful and assiduous search failed to reveal
the existence of any legal document like a will, and the lawyers
gravely assured Mrs. St. John that she could claim
only a third of her deceased husband's wealth, the remainder
falling to the next of kin, Howard Templeton.</p>

<p>"You see, madam," said the old lawyer, whom she was
anxiously questioning, "if Mr. St. John had left a child,
you could claim the whole estate as its lawful guardian,
even without the existence of a will. But there being no
nearer kin than Mr. Templeton, it legally falls to him, after
you receive your widow's portion."</p>

<p>The young widow brooded over those words night and
day.</p>

<p>She hated Howard Templeton more than ever.</p>

<p>She would have given the whole world, had it been hers,
to wrest that fortune from her enemy's grasp, and leave
him poor and friendless to fight his way through the hard
world.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I only could find that will," she thought wildly.
"Is it true that Mr. St. John made it, or was he deceiving
me? He was utterly insane. Could one expect truth from
a madman?"</p>

<p>Gradually, as weary weeks flew by, she began to believe
that Mr. St. John had deceived her.</p>

<p>She felt quite sure in her own mind, after a little while,
that he had never made the will.</p>

<p>He had fully meant for Howard Templeton to inherit
his wealth.</p>

<p>Yet bitterly as she regretted its loss she could not bring
herself to hate the memory of the old man she had married,
and who had loved her for a little while with so fond and
foolish a passion.</p>

<p>The memory of his dreadful death was too strong upon
her.</p>

<p>She woke at night from dreadful dreams that recalled that
last awful day of her husband's life, and lay shuddering and
weeping, and praying to forget that fearful face, and blood-curdling,
maniacal laugh that still rung in her shocked
hearing.</p>

<p>"You are growing thin and pale, Xenie," Mrs. Egerton
said, when she came to condole with her, more for the loss
of the fortune than the loss of her husband. "People are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
talking of your ill looks, and they say you take Mr. St.
John's death so hard, you must have cared for him more
than anyone believed. I let them talk, for, of course, it is
very much to your credit to have them think so, but as I
know better myself, I cannot help wondering at your paleness
and trouble."</p>

<p>"It was all so sudden and terrible," murmured the young
widow, as she lay back in her easy-chair, looking very
fragile and beautiful in her deep mourning dress.</p>

<p>"Yes it was very bad his going off in a fit that way,"
said her aunt. "Still, it was to be expected, Xenie. He
was very old, and really growing childish, I thought. His
going off without a will was the worst part of it. Of course
it hurt you terribly for Templeton to have the money!"</p>

<p>The sudden flash in Mrs. St. John's dark eyes told plainer
than words how much it had hurt her.</p>

<p>"However, Xenie, I would give over worrying about it,"
continued her aunt, soothingly.</p>

<p>"But my revenge, Aunt Egerton. Think how much I
sacrificed for it. I married that foolish old man, and endured
his caprices so long without a murmur, allowed myself
to be shut up in solitude like a bird in a cage, and
never murmured at his tiresome exactions. And all for
what? Because I expected to get his whole fortune, and be
revenged on the coward who broke my heart for the sake
of it. And to be despoiled of my revenge like this is too
hard for endurance," she exclaimed, walking up and down
the room, and wringing her white hands in a perfect passion
of despair and regret.</p>

<p>"Oh! let the wretch go," said Mrs. Egerton, complacently
rustling in her silks and laces. "You have secured a large
portion of the estate, anyhow. And you are so young and
beautiful still, Xenie, you may even marry a greater fortune
than that, when your year of mourning is expired."</p>

<p>Xenie stopped still in her excited walk, and looked at
her aunt.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry again&mdash;never," she said earnestly.
"I have as much money as I want, only&mdash;only I want to
take that from Howard Templeton because I want to humble
him and wring his heart. And there is but one way to
do it, and that is to reduce him to poverty. Money is the
only god he worships!" she added bitterly.</p>

<p>"He treated you villainously and deserves to be punished,"
said Mrs. Egerton, "but still I would try to forget
it, Xenie. You will lose your youth and prettiness brooding
over this idea of revenge."</p>

<p>"I will never forget it," cried Mrs. St. John, wrathfully.
"I will wait and watch, and if ever I see a chance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
punish Howard Templeton, I shall strike swiftly and
surely."</p>

<p>Her aunt arose, gathering her silken wrappings about
her tall, elegant form.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go now," she said. "I see it is of no use
talking to you. Come and see me when you feel better,
Xenie."</p>

<p>"I am going to the country next week," said her niece,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Indeed? Has not your mother been up to see you in
your trouble?" inquired Mrs. Egerton, pausing in her graceful
exit.</p>

<p>"No. I wrote to her, but she has neither come nor written.
I fear something has happened. She is usually very
punctual. Anyway, I shall go down next week and stay
with them a week or two."</p>

<p>"I hope the change may improve your spirits, love," said
her aunt, kissing her and going out with an airy "<i>Au
revoir</i>."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>"Mamma, how pale and troubled you look. What ails
you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John was crossing the threshold of the little cottage
home that looked, oh, so poor and cheap after the
stately brown-stone palace she had left that morning, and
after one quick glance into her mother's careworn face she
saw that new lines of grief and trouble had come upon it
since last they had met.</p>

<p>"Come up into my room, Xenie. I have much to say
to you," said her mother, leading the way up the narrow
stairway into her bedroom, a neat and scrupulously clean
little room, but plainly and almost poorly furnished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll was a widow with only a few barren acres of
land, which she hired a man to till. Her husband was long
since dead, and the burden of rearing her two children had
been a heavy one to the lonely widow, who came of a good
family and naturally desired to do well by her two daughters,
both of them being gifted with uncommon beauty.</p>

<p>But poverty had hampered and crushed her desires, and
made her an old woman while yet she was in the prime of
life.</p>

<p>Xenie removed her traveling wraps and sat down before
the little toilet glass to arrange her disordered hair.</p>

<p>"My dear, how pale and sad you look in your widow's
weeds," said Mrs. Carroll, regarding her attentively. "I
was very sorry to hear of your husband's death. It is very
sad to be left a widow so young&mdash;barely twenty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered Xenie, abstractedly; then she turned
around and said abruptly: "Mamma, where is my sister?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll looked at her daughter a moment without
replying.</p>

<p>"I have brought her some beautiful presents," continued
Mrs. St. John, "and you, too, dear mamma&mdash;things that
you will like&mdash;both beautiful and useful."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll looked at her daughter a moment in utter
silence, and her lips quivered strangely.</p>

<p>Then she caught up a corner of her homely check apron,
and hiding her convulsed face in its folds, she burst into
bitter weeping.</p>

<p>Xenie sprang up and threw her arms around the neck of
the agitated woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," she cried, anxiously, "speak to me. Tell
me what ails you? Where is Lora?"</p>

<p>As if that name had power to open the flood gates of
emotion wider, Mrs. Carroll wept more bitterly than ever.</p>

<p>"Mamma, you frighten me," cried Xenie, terrified. "Oh,
tell me where is Lora? Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;oh, better that she were!" sobbed her mother,
wildly.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John grew as pale as death. She shook her
mother almost rudely by the arm.</p>

<p>"What has Lora done?" she cried. "Where is she? I
will go and seek her."</p>

<p>She was rushing wildly to the door, but Mrs. Carroll
sprang forward, and catching the skirt of her dress, pulled
her back.</p>

<p>"Not now!" she gasped; "wait a little. That wretched
girl has ruined her good name and disgraced us all."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John dropped into a chair like one bereft of life,
and her great, black eyes, dilated with terror, stared up into
her mother's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is too true," said her mother, sitting down and
rocking herself back and forth, while low and heart-broken
moans escaped her white lips.</p>

<p>"But, mamma, poor, good, little Lora! it cannot be!
She was truth and innocence itself," panted the young
widow, in a voice of anguish.</p>

<p>"She deceived us all&mdash;she was a sly little piece. You will
see for yourself, Xenie. She lies ill in her chamber, and&mdash;and
in a few months there will be a"&mdash;she lowered her
voice and gave a fearful glance around her&mdash;"<i>a child</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh! mamma, then she was married? Of course Lora
was married! Doesn't she say so?" exclaimed Xenie, confidently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she swears to a marriage&mdash;a secret one&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
look you, Xenie&mdash;not a ring, not a witness, not a scrap of
paper to prove it! And the man dead&mdash;lost at sea!" said
Mrs. Carroll, despairingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! mamma, then it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack Mainwaring&mdash;yes. He was courting her this long
time, you know. He asked for her, and I wouldn't give
my consent. I thought he wasn't good enough for her&mdash;a
sailor, and only second mate, you know. And Aunt Egerton
had promised to give her a season in town this winter,
and she might have made a better match than a sailor."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll broke down again and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Try to control yourself, mamma," said the young widow,
stroking the bowed head tenderly. "And so Jack married
her in spite of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sobbed her mother, "he married her secretly, she
says. It was about the same time, or nearly, that you
were married. He found out that Lora was going to town
to be one of the bridesmaids, and was jealous, I suppose,
thinking she might see someone she could like better. So
he persuaded her into it, and they were to keep it secret
until he came back from this voyage."</p>

<p>"And he is lost at sea, you say?" asked Xenie, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes; he went away in a few weeks after the marriage,
to be gone six months; but the news came last week of the
loss of his ship by fire, and his name was on the list of the
dead. You see, Xenie, what a terrible position Lora was
placed in. She fainted when she heard the news, and then I
found out everything."</p>

<p>"Does anyone else know, mamma?" inquired Xenie,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not yet. She has been ill, but I have cared for her myself,
and did not call in the doctor. But we cannot keep it
a secret always. Of course malicious people will not believe
in the marriage, and Lora's fair fame will be ruined
forever! Oh! if she had only never been born!" cried the
proud and unhappy mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John sat silent, her lily-white hands clasped in
her lap, her dark eyes staring into vacancy with a strangely
intent expression. She roused herself at last and looked
at her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma, we must devise ways and means of keeping
this a secret! It would ruin the family to have it known,"
she said, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," said Mrs. Carroll, gloomily. "I
would do anything in the world to save Lora's fair fame if
I only knew what to do!"</p>

<p>"I have a plan," said Xenie, rising quietly. "I will tell
it you by-and-by, mamma. Everything shall come right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
if you will be guided by me. Now take me to my sister, if
you please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll rose silently and opened the door. Xenie
followed her down a narrow passage to a door at the further
end, and they entered a pretty and neat little room.</p>

<p>A low wood fire burned on the cleanly swept hearth, and
on the white bed, with her dark hair trailing loosely over
the pillows, lay a beautiful, white-faced girl, enough like
Xenie to be her twin.</p>

<p>She started up with a cry of mingled joy and pain as the
new-comer came toward her.</p>

<p>"My poor darling!" Mrs. St. John murmured, in a tone
of infinite love and compassion, as she twined her arms
around the trembling form.</p>

<p>Lora clung to her sister, sobbing and weeping convulsively.
At length she whispered against her shoulder:</p>

<p>"Mamma has told you all, Xenie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," was the gentle answer.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;you believe that I was married?" questioned
the invalid.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," whispered her sister, tenderly. "How
could I believe evil of you, my innocent, little Lora?"</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried the invalid, gratefully. "Oh! Xenie,
mamma has been so angry it nearly broke my heart."</p>

<p>"She will forgive you, darling," murmured Mrs. St. John,
fondly, as she stroked the dark head nestling on her breast.</p>

<p>"And, oh, Xenie, poor Jack&mdash;my Jack&mdash;he is dead!"
sobbed Lora, bursting into a fit of wild, hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>"There, darling, hush&mdash;you must not excite yourself,"
said Mrs. St. John, laying her sister back upon the pillows,
and trying to soothe her frenzied excitement.</p>

<p>"And no one will believe that I was Jack's wife&mdash;I am
disgraced forever! Mamma says so. The finger of scorn
will be pointed at me everywhere. But what do I care,
since my heart is broken? I only want to die!" moaned the
unhappy young creature, as she tossed to and fro upon the
bed.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Lora; listen to me," said Mrs. St. John, taking
the restless, white hands in her own, and sitting down upon
the bed. "I wish to talk to you as soon as you become
reasonable."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Lora hushed her sobs by a great effort, and
lay perfectly still but for the uncontrollable heaving of her
troubled breast, her large, hollow, dark eyes fixed earnestly
on Xenie's pale and lovely face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll crouched down in a chair by the side of the
bed, the image of hopeless woe.</p>

<p>"Lora, dear," said her sister, in low, earnest tones, "of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
course you know that, if this dreadful thing becomes known,
the disgrace will be reflected upon us all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll groaned, and Lora murmured a pitiful yes.</p>

<p>"I have thought of a plan to save you," continued Mrs.
St. John. "A clever plan that would shield your fair fame
forever. But it will require some co-operation on your part,
and it may be that you and mamma may refuse for you to
undertake it."</p>

<p>"You may count on my consent beforehand!" groaned
Mrs. Carroll, desperately.</p>

<p>"I will do whatever mamma says," murmured Lora,
weakly.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John looked away from them a moment in silent
thought; then she said, slowly:</p>

<p>"Of course, you know, mamma, that my husband died
without a will, and that Howard Templeton inherited the
greater part of his wealth?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you wrote me. I was very sorry that you were
disappointed, dear," said her mother, gently, yet wondering
what this had to do with Lora's forlorn case.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Xenie, slowly, "if my husband had left
me as Lora's left her, I could have kept that fortune out of
Howard Templeton's hands."</p>

<p>"My dear, I hardly understand you," said her mother,
blankly.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I mean that if I could hope for an heir to my
husband, the child would inherit all that wealth, and Howard
Templeton be left penniless."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I understand you now," was the quick reply,
"but you have no prospect, no hope of such a thing&mdash;have
you, dear?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and Mrs. St. John's fair
face grew scarlet, then deadly white again. She looked
away from her mother, and said, slowly:</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I have such a hope. Listen to me, you
and Lora, and I will help you in your trouble, and you shall
help me to complete my revenge."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>Some three or four weeks after Mrs. St. John's visit to
the country, Howard Templeton was sitting in his club
one day, smoking and reading, after a most luxurious
lunch.</p>

<p>The young fellow looked very comfortable as he leaned
back in his cushioned chair, the blue smoke curling in airy
rings over his curly, blonde head, a look of lazy contentment
in his handsome blue eyes.</p>

<p>He was somewhat of a Sybarite in his tastes, this handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
young fellow, over whose head twenty-five happy
years had rolled serenely, without a shadow to mar their
brightness save that unfortunate love affair two years
before.</p>

<p>Howard was, emphatically, one of the "gilded youth" of
his day. He "toiled not, neither did he spin." He had been
cradled in luxury's silken lap all his life long.</p>

<p>Sorrow had passed him tenderly by as one exempt from
the common ills of life.</p>

<p>He was so accustomed to his good luck that he seldom
gave a thought to it. It simply seemed to him that he
would go on that way forever.</p>

<p>Yet, to-day, for a wonder, he had been a little thoughtfully
reviewing the events of the past six months.</p>

<p>"It was very kind in Uncle John to leave things so comfortable
for me," he said to himself. "I thought his wife
would influence him against me so much that he wouldn't
have left me a penny. If he hadn't, what the deuce should
I have done?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, in comical amusement, to survey
the situation; but the idea was too stupendous.</p>

<p>He could not even fancy himself the victim of adversity,
much less tell what he would have done in that case. He
laughed at it after a moment.</p>

<p>"I cannot even imagine it," he thought. "Poor little
Xenie, how hard it went with her to be foiled in her revenge,
as she called it. How she must have loved me to
have turned against me so when I gave her up! Who would
have believed that we two should ever hate each other with
such a deadly hate?"</p>

<p>Something like a smothered sigh went upward with the
blue cigar smoke, and just then a footstep crossed the
threshold, and a man's voice said, lightly:</p>

<p>"Halloo, Doctor Templeton; enjoying yourself, as usual."</p>

<p>"Halloo, Doctor Shirley," returned Templeton, with a
lazy nod at the new-comer. "Have a smoke?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do," said the doctor, throwing himself
down in an easy-chair opposite the speaker, and lighting a
weed. "How deuced comfortable you look, my boy!"</p>

<p>"Feel that way," lisped Templeton, in a lazy tone.</p>

<p>"Ah! I don't think you would feel so devil-may-care if
you knew all that I know, old boy," laughed the doctor,
significantly.</p>

<p>The old doctor was very well known at the club as a gossip,
so Templeton only laughed carelessly as he said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, doctor? Any of my sweethearts
sick or dead?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Doctor Shirley. "However,
Templeton, if any of your sweethearts has money, take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
advice, young fellow, and make up to her without delay."</p>

<p>Howard Templeton laughed at the doctor's sage advice.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, "but I do very well as I am, doctor.
I don't care to become a subject for petticoat government,
yet."</p>

<p>"Yet things looked that way two years ago," said Doctor
Shirley, maliciously, for Templeton's ardent devotion to
Mrs. Egerton's lovely <i>debutante</i> at that time had been no
secret in society.</p>

<p>Templeton's blonde face flushed a dark red all over, yet
he laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I had the fever," he said. "However, its severity
then precludes the danger of ever having a second
attack. How little I dreamed that she would be my aunt."</p>

<p>"Or your <i>bete noire</i>," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Hardly that," said Templeton, composedly, as he
knocked the ashes from the end of his cigar. "True, she
has taken a slice of my fortune away, but then there's yet
enough to butter my bread."</p>

<p>"There may not be much longer," said Doctor Shirley,
meaningly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Templeton, looking at him
as if he had serious doubts of his sanity. "Who's going to
take it away from me? Has Mrs. St. John found the will
she talked of so much?"</p>

<p>"No," said Doctor Shirley, "but she has found something
that will serve her as well."</p>

<p>"Confound it, doctor, I don't understand you at all,"
said the young fellow, a little testily. "What are you
driving at, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Templeton, honestly, I hate to tell you," said the physician,
sobering down, "but I've bad news for you. You
know that Mrs. St. John has been ill lately, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it&mdash;thought, perhaps, she meant to shuffle
off this mortal coil and leave me the balance of my uncle's
property," said the young man, imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Nothing further from her thoughts, I assure you," was
the laughing reply. "She has been quite ill, but she is
well enough to come down into the drawing-room to-day.
Come, now, Templeton, guess what I have to tell you?"</p>

<p>"'Pon honor, doctor, I haven't the faintest idea. Does it
refer to my fair and respected aunt? Is it a new freak of
hers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, decidedly a new freak," said the doctor, laughing
heartily, and enjoying his joke very much.</p>

<p>"Well, then, out with it," said Howard, growing impatient.
"Does she accuse me of stealing and secreting that
fabulous missing will?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," and Doctor Shirley rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
threw away his half-smoked cigar, saying, carelessly: "I
must be going. We poor devils of doctors never have time
to smoke a whole cigar. Say, Templeton, Mrs. St. John
has her mother and sister staying with her. Deuced handsome
girl, that Lora Carroll! Very like her sister! And&mdash;don't
go off in a fit, now, Templeton&mdash;in a very few months
there will be a little heir to your deceased uncle's name and
fortune!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" exclaimed Howard Templeton,
springing to his feet, while his handsome face grew white
and red by turns.</p>

<p>"You don't believe it? That's because you don't want to
believe it. But I give you my word and honor as a professional
man and her medical attendant, that it is a self-evident
fact," and laughing at his, little joke, the gossiping old doctor
hurried away from the club-room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>"I don't believe it!" Howard Templeton repeated angrily,
as he stood still where Doctor Shirley had left him, those
unexpected words ringing through his brain.</p>

<p>"What is it you don't believe, Templeton?" inquired one
of the "gilded youth," dawdling in and overhearing the
remark.</p>

<p>"I don't believe anything&mdash;that's my creed," answered
Templeton, snatching his hat, and hurrying out. He wanted
to be out in the cold, fresh air. Somehow it seemed to him
as if a hand grasped his throat, choking his life out.</p>

<p>He walked aimlessly up and down the crowded thoroughfare,
seemingly blind and deaf to all that went on around
him.</p>

<p>Men's eyes remarked the tall, well-proportioned form and
handsome, blonde face with envy.</p>

<p>Women looked after him admiringly, thinking how
splendid it would be to have such a man for a lover.
Howard heeded nothing of it. He was accustomed to it.
He simply took it for his due, and he had other things to
engross his mind now.</p>

<p>"It can't be true, it can't be true," he said to himself,
again and again in his restless walk. "It is the most undreamed
of thing. Who could believe it?"</p>

<p>And yet it troubled him despite his incredulity. It
troubled him so much that he went to see a lawyer about
it.</p>

<p>He stated the case, and asked him frankly what were his
chances if such a thing really should happen.</p>

<p>"No chance at all," was the grim reply. "If you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not resign your claim, Mrs. St. John would naturally sue
you for the money on behalf of the legal heir."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Howard.</p>

<p>"The case would certainly go against you."</p>

<p>Howard went out again and took another walk. He tried
to fancy himself&mdash;Howard Templeton, the golden youth&mdash;face
to face with the grim fiend, poverty.</p>

<p>He wondered how it would feel to earn his dinner before
he ate it, to wear out his old coats, and have to count the
cost of new ones, as he had vaguely heard that poor men
had to do.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine it," he said to himself. "Time enough
to bother my brain with such conundrums if the thing
really comes to pass. And if it does, what a glorious
triumph it will be for 'mine enemy!' I'd like to see her&mdash;by
Jove, I believe I'll go there."</p>

<p>He stopped short, filled with the new idea, then hurried
on, recalled to himself by a stare of surprise from a casual
passer-by.</p>

<p>"Yes; why shouldn't I go there, by George?" he went on.
"It was my home before she came there. The world doesn't
know that we are 'at outs,' although we are sworn foes
privately. I'll pretend to call on Lora Carroll. Lora was
a pretty girl enough when I was down there that summer,
young and unformed, though time has remedied that defect,
doubtless. Doctor Shirley thought her handsome.
Yes, I will call on little Lora. A daring thing to do, perhaps,
but then I'm in the mood for daring a great deal."</p>

<p>The lamps were lighted and the glare of the gas flared
down upon him as he thus made up his mind.</p>

<p>He went to his hotel, made an elaborate and elegant toilet,
as if anxious to please, then sallied forth toward the brown-stone
palace where his enemy reigned in triumph.</p>

<p>A soft and subdued light shone through the curtains of
rose-colored silk and creamy lace that shaded the windows
of the drawing-room. A fancy seized upon Howard to peep
through them before he went up the marble steps and sent
in his card.</p>

<p>"For who knows that they may decline to see me," he
thought, "and I am determined to get one look at Xenie.
I want to see if she looks very happy over her triumph."</p>

<p>He glanced around, saw that no one was passing, and
cautiously went up to the window.</p>

<p>It was as much as he could do, tall as he was, to peer into
the room by standing on tiptoe.</p>

<p>He looked into the beautiful and spacious room where he
had spent many happy hours with his deceased uncle in
years gone by, and a sigh to the memory of those old days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
breathed softly over his lips, and a dimness came into his
bright blue eyes.</p>

<p>He brushed it away, and looked around for the beautiful
woman who had come between him and the poor old man
who had brought him up as his heir.</p>

<p>He saw two ladies in the room.</p>

<p>One of them was quite elderly, and had gray hair crimped
beneath a pretty cap.</p>

<p>She wore black silk, and sat on a sofa trifling over a bit
of fancy knitting.</p>

<p>"That is Mrs. Carroll," he said to himself. "She is a
pretty old lady, though she looks so old and careworn.
But she is poor, and that explains it. I dare say I shall
grow gray and careworn too when Mrs. St. John takes my
uncle's money from me, and I have to earn my bread before
I eat it."</p>

<p>He saw another lady standing with her back to him by
the piano.</p>

<p>She was <i>petite</i> and slender, with a crown of braided black
hair, and her robe of rich, wine-colored silk and velvet
trailed far behind her on the costly carpet.</p>

<p>She stood perfectly still for a few moments, then turned
slowly around, and he saw her face.</p>

<p>"Why, it is Xenie herself!" he exclaimed. "Doctor
Shirley lied to me, and I was fool enough to believe his silly
joke. Heaven! what I have suffered through my foolish
credulity! I've a mind to call Shirley out and shoot him
for his atrocity!"</p>

<p>He remained silent a little while studying the lady's dark,
beautiful, smiling face, when suddenly he saw the door unclose,
and a lady, dressed in the deepest sables of mourning,
entered and walked across the floor and sat down by
Mrs. Carroll's side upon the sofa.</p>

<p>Howard Templeton started, and a hollow groan broke
from his lips.</p>

<p>"My God!" he breathed to himself, "I was mistaken.
It is Lora, of course, in that bright-hued dress. How like
she is to Xenie! I ought to have remembered that my
uncle's wife would be in mourning. Yes, that is Xenie by
her mother's side, and Doctor Shirley told me the fatal
truth!"</p>

<p>He walked away from the window, and made several
hurried turns up and down before the house.</p>

<p>"Shall I go in?" he asked himself. "I know all I came
for, now. Yes, I will be fool enough to go in anyhow."</p>

<p>He went up the steps and rang the bell, waiting nervously
for the great, carved door to open.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>The door swung slowly open, and the gray-haired old
servitor whom Howard could remember from childhood,
took his card and disappeared down the hallway.</p>

<p>Presently he returned, and informed the young man that
the ladies would receive him; and Howard, half regretting,
when too late, the hasty impulse that had prompted him
enter, was ushered into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The next moment he found himself returning a stiff, icy
bow from his uncle's widow, a half-embarrassed greeting
from Mrs. Carroll, and shaking hands with the beautiful
Lora, who gave him a shy yet perfectly self-possessed welcome
and referred to his visit to the country two years before
in a pretty, <i>naive</i> way, showing that she remembered
him perfectly; although, as she averred, she was little
more than a child at the time.</p>

<p>They sat down, and he and Miss Carroll had the talk
mostly to themselves, though now and then his glance
strayed from her bright, vivacious countenance to the sad,
white face of the young widow sitting beside her mother on
the sofa, the dark lashes shading her colorless cheeks, a
sorrowful droop about her beautiful lips as if her thoughts
dwelt on some mournful theme.</p>

<p>Howard had heard people say that she looked ill and
pale since Mr. St. John's death, and that after all she must
have cared for him a little.</p>

<p>He knew better than that, of course, yet he could not but
acknowledge that she played the part of a bereaved wife to
perfection.</p>

<p>"It looks like real grief," he said to himself; "but, of
course, I know that it is the loss of the money and not
the man that weighs her spirits down so heavily."</p>

<p>"You resemble your sister very much, Miss Carroll," he
said to Lora, after a little while. "If I were an Irishman,
I should say that you look more like your sister than you
do like yourself."</p>

<p>The careless, yet odd little speech seemed to have an inexplicable
effect upon Lora Carroll. She started violently,
her cheeks lost their soft, pink color, the bright smile faded
from her lips, and she gave the speaker a keen, half-furtive
glance from under her dark-fringed eyelashes.</p>

<p>She tried to laugh, but it sounded forced and unnatural.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll, who had been silently listening, broke in
carelessly before Lora could speak:</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Lora and Xenie are exceedingly like each
other, Mr. Templeton. Their aunt, Mrs. Egerton, says that
Lora is now the living image of Xenie, when she first came
to the city, two years ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I quite agree with her," Mr. Templeton answered, in a
light tone, and with a bow to Mrs. Carroll. "The resemblance
is very striking."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he moved his chair forward, carelessly yet
deliberately, so that he might look into Mrs. St. John's
beautiful, pale face.</p>

<p>The young widow did not seem to relish his furtive contemplation.
She flushed slightly, and her white hands
clasped and unclasped themselves nervously, as they lay
folded together in her lap.</p>

<p>She turned her head to one side that she might not encounter
the full gaze of his eyes. He smiled to himself at
her embarrassment and, turning from her, allowed his gaze
to rest upon the bright fire burning behind the polished
steel bars of the grate.</p>

<p>A momentary unpleasant silence fell upon them all.
Lora broke it after a moment's thought by saying, carelessly,
as she opened the piano:</p>

<p>"I remember that you used to sing very well, Mr. Templeton.
Won't you favor us now?"</p>

<p>"Lora, my dear," Mrs. Carroll said, in a gently-shocked
voice, "you forget that music may not be agreeable to
your sister so recently bereaved."</p>

<p>"Oh, Xenie, dear, I beg your pardon," began Lora, turning
around, but Mrs. St. John interrupted her by saying,
wearily:</p>

<p>"Never mind, mamma, never mind, Lora. I&mdash;I&mdash;my
head aches&mdash;I will retire if you will excuse me, and then
you may have all the music you wish."</p>

<p>She arose from her seat, gave Mr. Templeton a chill, little
bow which he returned as coldly, then went slowly
from the room, trailing her sable robes behind her like a
pall.</p>

<p>"As cold as ice, by Jove," was Howard's mental comment;
"yet she did not appear particularly elated over her
prospective triumph. Strange!"</p>

<p>He crossed over to the piano where Lora was restlessly
turning over some sheets of music.</p>

<p>"Won't you sing to me, Miss Carroll?" he asked, in a
soft, alluring voice.</p>

<p>Lora sat down on the music-stool and laughed as she ran
her white fingers over the pearl keys.</p>

<p>"Excuse me&mdash;I do not sing," she said, carelessly. "But
I will play your accompaniment if you will select a song."</p>

<p>"You do not sing," he said, as he began to turn over the
music. "Ah! there is one point at least in which you do
not resemble your sister. Mrs. St. John has a very fine
voice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Xenie's voice has been well trained," she answered,
carelessly; "but I do not care to sing, I would rather
hear others."</p>

<p>"How will this please you?" he inquired, selecting a song
and laying it up before her.</p>

<p>She glanced at it and answered composedly:</p>

<p>"As well as any. I remember this song. I heard you
sing it with Xenie that summer."</p>

<p>"Yes, our voices went well together," he answered, as
carelessly. "I wish you would sing it with me now?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, but I will play it for you. Shall we begin
now?"</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, looking down at her as she sat
there with down-drooped eyes, the gleam of the firelight
and gaslight shining on the black braids of her hair and the
rich, warm-hued dress that was so very becoming to her
dark, bright beauty.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw something on the white hand that was
softly touching the piano keys. He took the slim fingers in
his before she was aware.</p>

<p>"Let me see your ring," he said. "It looks familiar.
Ah, it is the one I gave you that winter when we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She threw back her head and looked at him with wide,
angry, black eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she said imperiously. "Are you
crazy, Mr. Templeton? It is the ring you gave Xenie, certainly,
but not me!"</p>

<p>"Lora, love," said her mother's voice from the sofa, in
mild reproval. "Do not be rude to Mr. Templeton."</p>

<p>"Mamma, I don't mean to," said Lora, without turning
her head; "but he&mdash;he spoke as if I were Xenie."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Carroll," said the offender, with
a teasing look in his blue eyes, which she did not see; "I
did not mean to offend, but do you know that in talking
with you, I constantly find myself under the impression
that I am talking to your sister. It is one effect of the
wonderful resemblance, I presume."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," admitted Lora; "but," she continued,
in a tone of pretty, girlish pique, "I wish you would try
and recollect the difference. I am two years younger than
my sister, remember, and so it is not a compliment to be
taken for a person older than myself!"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Mr. Templeton, soothingly; "but it
was the ring, please remember, that led me into error this
time. You see, I gave it to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you gave it to Xenie," broke in Lora, promptly
and coolly; "yes, I know that, but you see she was tired
of it, or rather she did not care for it any more&mdash;so she
gave it to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>His face whitened angrily, but he said, with assumed
carelessness:</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;do you care for it, Miss Carroll?"</p>

<p>She lifted her hand and looked at the flashing ruby with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like it. It is very handsome, and must have cost
a large sum of money&mdash;more than I ever saw, probably,
at one time in my life, I suppose, for I am poor, as you
know."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to have some music, Lora,"
exclaimed Mrs. Carroll, gasping audibly over her knitting.
"You weary Mr. Templeton with your idle talk."</p>

<p>"He began it, mamma," said Lora, carelessly. "Well,
Mr. Templeton, I'm going to begin the accompaniment.
Get ready."</p>

<p>She touched the keys with skillful fingers, waking a soft,
melancholy prelude, and Howard sang in his full, rich, tenor
voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Hapless doom of woman happy in betrothing!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beauty passes like a breath, and love is lost in loathing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Low, my lute; speak low, my lute, but say the world is nothing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Low, lute, low!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Love will hover round the flowers when they first awaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love will fly the fallen leaf, and not be overtaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Low, my lute! oh, low, my lute! we fade and are forsaken&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Low, dear lute, low!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The poet has very happily blended truth and poesy in
that very pathetic song," remarked Lora, with a touch of
careless scorn in her voice, as the rich notes ceased. "Well,
Mr. Templeton, will you try another song?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Miss Carroll&mdash;I must be going. I have
already trespassed upon your time and patience."</p>

<p>Lora did not gainsay the assertion.</p>

<p>She rose with an almost audible sigh of relief, and stood
waiting for him to say good-night.</p>

<p>"May I come and see you again?" he asked, as he bowed
over the delicate hand that wore his ruby ring.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;we&mdash;that is, mamma and I&mdash;are going away soon. It
may not&mdash;perhaps&mdash;be convenient for us to receive you
again," stammered Lora, hesitating and blushing like the
veriest school-girl.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am sorry," he said; "well, then, good-night, and
good-bye."</p>

<p>He shook hands with both, holding Lora's hand a trifle
longer than necessary, then courteously turned away.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the beautiful girl knelt down by her
mother and lifted her flushed and brilliant face with a look
of inquiry upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, mamma?" she questioned, gravely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>"My dear, you acted splendidly," she said, "and so did
your sister. I was afraid at first. I thought you were
wrong to admit him. It was a terrible test, for the eyes of
hatred are even keener than those of love. I trembled for
you at first, but you stood the trial nobly. He was completely
hoodwinked. No fear now. If you could blind
Howard Templeton to the truth, there can be no trouble
with the rest of the world."</p>

<p>"And yet once or twice I was terribly frightened," said
the girl musingly. "The looks he gave me, the tones of
his voice, sometimes his very words, made me tremble with
fear. It was, as you say, a terrible test, but I am glad now
that I risked it, for I believe that I have succeeded in blinding
him. All goes well with us, mamma. Doctor Shirley
and Howard Templeton have been completely deceived.
The rest will be very easy of accomplishment."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>Thanks to the gossiping tongue of old Doctor Shirley, the
interesting news regarding Mrs. St. John speedily became
a widespread and accepted fact in society.</p>

<p>It was quite a nine days' wonder at first, and in connection
with its discussion a vast deal of speculation was
indulged in regarding the possible future of Mr. Howard
Templeton, the fair and gilded youth whose heritage might
soon be wrested from him, leaving him to battle single-handed
with the world.</p>

<p>Before people had stopped wondering over it, Mrs. Egerton
added her quota to the excitement by the information
that her niece, Mrs. St. John, had gone abroad, taking her
mother and sister with her.</p>

<p><i>She</i> had wanted Lora with <i>her</i> that season&mdash;she had long
ago promised Mrs. Carroll to give Lora a season in the city&mdash;but
the girl was so wild over the idea of travel that Xenie
had taken her with her for company, acting on the advice
of Doctor Shirley, who declared that change of scene and
cheerful company were actually essential to the preservation
of the young invalid's life.</p>

<p>The old doctor, when people interrogated him, confirmed
Mrs. Egerton's assertion.</p>

<p>He said that Mrs. St. John had fallen into a state of depression
and melancholy so deep as to threaten her health
and even her life.</p>

<p>He had advocated an European tour as the most likely
means of rousing her from her grief and restoring her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
cheerful spirits, and she had taken him at his word and
gone.</p>

<p>So when Howard Templeton, who had gone down into the
country on a little mysterious mission of his own the day
after his visit to Lora Carroll, returned to the city, he was
electrified by the announcement that Mrs. St. John, with her
mother and sister, had sailed for Europe two days previous.</p>

<p>Howard was unfeignedly surprised and confounded at the
news.</p>

<p>His face was a study for a physiognomist as he revolved
it in his mind.</p>

<p>He went to his private room, ensconced himself in the
easiest chair, elevated his feet several degrees higher than
his head, and with his fair, clustering locks and bright, blue
eyes half obscured in a cloud of cigar smoke, tried to
digest the astonishing fact which he had just learned.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to do so.</p>

<p>The brain beneath the white brow and fair, clustering curls
was a very clear and lucid one.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet at last, and said aloud:</p>

<p>"How clever she is, to be sure! It is the most natural
thing in the world and the easiest way of carrying out her
daring scheme. How perfectly it will smooth over everything."</p>

<p>He walked up and down the richly carpeted room in his
blue Turkish silk dressing-gown, his dark brows drawn together
in a thoughtful frown, the lights and shades of conflicting
feelings faithfully mirrored on his fair and handsome
face.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said, aloud, presently, as if discussing
some vexed problem with his inner consciousness. "Why
not? I have as good a right to follow as she had to go. I
need have no compunctions about spending Uncle John's
money. The stroke of fate has not fallen yet. The fabled
sword of Damocles hangs suspended over my head, still it
may never fall. And in the meantime, why shouldn't I
enjoy an European tour? I will, by Jove, I'll follow my
Lady Lora by the next steamer. And then&mdash;ah, then&mdash;checkmate
my lady."</p>

<p>He laughed grimly, and nodded at his full length reflection
in the long pier-glass at the end of the room.</p>

<p>Then after that moment of exultation a different mood
seemed to come over him. His handsome face became
grave and even sad.</p>

<p>Throwing himself down carelessly upon a luxurious divan,
he took up a volume of poetry lying near and tried to
lose himself in its pages.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas! how easily things go wrong,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i1">A sigh too much or a kiss too long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And there follows a mist and a blushing rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And life is never the same again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He read the words out moodily, then threw the book
down impatiently upon the floor.</p>

<p>"These foolish poets!" he said, half-angrily. "They
seem always to be aiming at the sore spots in a fellow's
heart. How they rake over the ashes of a dead love and
strew them along one's path. Love! how strange the word
sounds now, when I hate <i>her</i> so bitterly!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>"Darling, how beautiful the sea is. Look how the sun
sparkles on the emerald waves, like millions and millions
of the brightest diamonds."</p>

<p>Poor little Lora, sitting in the easy-chair on the wide veranda
of the little ornate cottage, a forlorn little figure in
the deepest of sables, looked up in her sister's face an instant,
then burst into a passion of bitter tears.</p>

<p>"The sea, the sea," she moaned despairingly. "Oh! why
did you bring me here? I hate the sight and the sound of
it! Oh! my poor Jack! my poor Jack!"</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John and Mrs. Carroll exchanged compassionate
yet troubled glances, and the latter said gently, yet remonstratingly:</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, indeed you must not give up to your
feelings on every occasion like this. In your weak state
of health it is positively dangerous to allow such excitement."</p>

<p>"I don't care, I don't care," wept Lora wildly, hiding her
convulsed face against Xenie's compassionate breast. "My
heart is broken! I have nothing left to live for, and I wish
that I were dead!"</p>

<p>"Darling, let me lead you in. Perhaps if you will lie
down and rest you will feel better in both body and mind,"
said Mrs. St. John, in the gentle, pitying accents used to a
sick child.</p>

<p>Lora arose obediently, and leaning on Xenie's arm, was
led into her little, airy, white-hung chamber. There her sister
persuaded her to lie down upon a lounge while she hovered
about her, rendering numberless gentle little attentions,
and talking to her in soft, soothing tones.</p>

<p>"Xenie, you are so kind to me," said the invalid, looking
at her sister, with a beam of gratitude shining in her large,
tearful, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"It is a selfish kindness after all, though, my darling,"
said Mrs. St. John, gently, "for you know I expect a great
reward for what I have done for you. My sisterly duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and my own selfish interest have gone hand-in-hand in this
case."</p>

<p>A bright, triumphant smile flashed over her beautiful
features as she spoke, and the invalid, looking at her,
sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"Xenie," she said, half-hesitatingly, "do not be angry,
dear, but I wish you would give up this wild passion of
revenge that possesses you. I lie awake nights thinking of
it and of my troubles, and I feel more and more that it will
be a dreadful deception. Are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?" inquired her sister, with a little, impatient
ring in the clear, musical tones of her voice.</p>

<p>"Afraid of&mdash;of being found out," said Lora, sinking her
voice to the faintest whisper.</p>

<p>"There is not the least danger," returned her sister, confidently.
"We have managed everything so cleverly there
will never be the faintest clew even if the ruse were ever
suspected, which it will never be, for who would dream of
such a thing? Lora, my dear little sister, I would do much
for you, but don't ask me to give up my revenge upon
Howard Templeton. I hate him so for his despicable
cowardice that nothing on earth would tempt me to forego
the sweetness of my glorious vengeance."</p>

<p>"Yet once you loved him," said Lora, with a grave wonder
in her sad, white face.</p>

<p>She stared and flushed at Lora's gently reproachful
words.</p>

<p>She remembered suddenly that someone else had said
those words to her in just the same tone of wonder and reproach.</p>

<p>The night of her short-lived triumph came back into her
mind&mdash;that brilliant bridal-night when she and Howard
Templeton had declared war against each other&mdash;war to the
knife.</p>

<p>"Yes, once I loved him," she said, with a tone of bitter
self-scorn. "But listen to me, Lora. Suppose Jack had
treated you as Howard Templeton did me?"</p>

<p>"Jack could not have done it; he loved me too truly,"
said Lora, lifting her head in unconscious pride.</p>

<p>"You are right, Lora, Jack Mainwaring could not have
done it. Few men could have been so base," said Xenie,
bitterly. "But, Lora, dear, suppose he <i>had</i> treated you so
cruelly&mdash;mind, I only say suppose&mdash;should you not have
hated him for it, and wanted to make his heart ache in return?"</p>

<p>Lora was silent a moment. The beautiful young face, so
like Xenie's in outline and coloring, so different in its expression
of mournful despair, took on an expression of deep
tenderness and gentleness as she said, at length:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"No Xenie, I could not have hated Jack even if he had
acted like Mr. Templeton. I am very poor-spirited perhaps;
but I believe if Jack had treated me so I might have
hated the sin, but I could not have helped loving the sinner."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lora, you do not know how you would have felt in
such a case. You have been mercifully spared the trial.
Let us drop the subject," answered Xenie, a little shortly.</p>

<p>Lora sighed wearily and turned her head away, throwing
her black-bordered handkerchief over her face.</p>

<p>Her sister stood still a moment, watching the quiet, recumbent
figure, then went to the window, and, drawing the
lace curtains aside, stood silently looking out at the beautiful
sea, with the sunset glories reflected in the opalescent
waves, the soft, spring breeze fluttering the silken rings of
dark hair that shaded her broad, white brow.</p>

<p>As she stood there in the soft sunset light in her bright
young beauty and rich attire, a smile of proud triumph
curved her scarlet lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, Howard Templeton," she mused, "the hour of my
triumph is close at hand."</p>

<p>And then, in a gentler tone, while a shade of anxiety
clouded her face, she added:</p>

<p>"But poor little Lora! Pray God all may go well with
her!"</p>

<p>The roseate hues of sunset faded slowly out, and the
purple twilight began to obscure everything.</p>

<p>One by one the little stars sparkled out and took their
wonted places in the bright constellations of Heaven.</p>

<p>Still Xenie remained motionless at the window, and still
Lora lay quietly on her couch, her pale, anguished young
face hidden beneath the mourning handkerchief.</p>

<p>Her sister turned around once and looked at her, thinking
she was asleep.</p>

<p>But suddenly in the darkness that began to pervade the
room, Xenie caught a faint and smothered moan of pain.</p>

<p>Instantly she hurried to Lora's side.</p>

<p>"My dear, are you in pain?" she said.</p>

<p>Lora raised herself and looked at Xenie's anxious face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, yes, dear," she said, in a frightened tone; "I am
ill. Pray go and send mother to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John pressed a tender kiss on the pain-drawn
lips and hurried out to seek her mother.</p>

<p>She found her in the little dining-room of the cottage laying
the cloth and making the tea. She looked up with a
gentle, motherly smile.</p>

<p>"My dear, you are hungry for your tea&mdash;you and Lora, I
expect," she said. "I let the maid go home to stay with
her ailing mother to-night, and promised to make the tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
myself. It will be ready now in a minute. Is Lora asleep?"</p>

<p>"Lora is ill, mamma. I will finish the tea, and you must
go to her," said Xenie, with a quiver in her low voice, as
she took the cloth from her mother's hand.</p>

<p>"Lora sick?" said Mrs. Carroll. "Well, Xenie, I rather
expected it. I will go to her. Never mind about the tea,
dear, unless you want some yourself."</p>

<p>She bustled out, and Xenie went on mechanically setting
the tea-things on the little round table, scarcely conscious
of what she was doing, so heavy was her heart.</p>

<p>She loved her sister with as fond a love as ever throbbed
in a sister's breast and Lora's peril roused her sympathies
to their highest pitch.</p>

<p>Finishing her simple task at last, she filled a little china
cup with fragrant tea and carried it to the patient's room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had enveloped Lora in her snowy embroidered
night-robe, and she lay upon the bed looking very pale
and preternaturally calm to Xenie's excited fancy.</p>

<p>She drank a little of the tea, then sent Xenie away
with it, telling her that she felt quite easy then.</p>

<p>"Go and sit on the veranda as usual, my dear," Mrs. Carroll
said, kindly. "I will sit with Lora myself."</p>

<p>"You will call me if I am needed?" asked Mrs. St. John,
hesitating on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>So Xenie went away very sad and heavy-hearted, as if
the burden of some intangible sorrow rested painfully upon
her oppressed and aching heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>Xenie sat down in the easy-chair on the veranda and
looked out at the mystical sea spread out before her gaze,
with the moon and stars mirrored in its restless bosom.</p>

<p>Everything was very still. No sound came to her ears
save the restless beat of the waves upon the shore. She
leaned forward with her arms folded on the veranda rail,
and her chin in the hollow of one pink palm, gazing directly
forward with dark eyes full of heavy sadness and pain.</p>

<p>She was tired and depressed. Lora had been ill and restless
for many nights past, and Xenie and Mrs. Carroll had
kept alternate vigils by her sleepless couch.</p>

<p>The last night had been Xenie's turn, and now the
strange, narcotic influence of her grief for Lora combined
with physical weariness to weigh her eyelids down.</p>

<p>After an interval of anxious listening for sounds from the
sick-room, her heavy head dropped wearily on her folded
arms, and she fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Sleeping, she dreamed. It seemed to her that Howard
Templeton, whom once she loved so madly, whom now she
bitterly hated, came to her side, and looking down upon
her in the sweet spring moonlight, laid his hand upon her
and said, gravely, and almost imploringly:</p>

<p>"Xenie, this is the turning-point in your life. Two paths
lay before you. Choose the right one and all will go well
with you. Peace and happiness will be yours. But choose
the evil path and the finger of scorn will one day be pointed
at you so that you will not dare to lift your eyes for
shame."</p>

<p>In her dream Xenie thought that she threw off her enemy's
hand with scorn and loathing.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to her that he gathered her up in his arms
and was about to cast her into the deep, terrible sea, when
she awoke with a great start, and found herself struggling
in the arms of her mother, who had lifted her out of the
chair, and was saying, impatiently:</p>

<p>"Xenie, Xenie! child, wake up. You will get your death
of cold sleeping out here in the damp night air, and the
wind and moisture from the sea blowing over you."</p>

<p>Xenie shook herself free from her mother's grasp, and
looked around her for her deadly foe, so real had seemed
her dream.</p>

<p>But she saw no tall, proud, manly form, no handsome,
blonde face gazing down upon her as she looked.</p>

<p>There was only the cold, white moonlight lying in silvery
bars on the floor, and her mother still shaking her by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Xenie, Xenie, wake up," she reiterated. "Here I have
been shaking and shaking you, and all in vain. You slept
like the dead."</p>

<p>"Mamma, I was dreaming," said Mrs. St. John, coming
back to herself with a start. "What is the matter? What
is the matter? Is my sister worse?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll took her daughter's hand and drew her inside
the hallway, then shut and locked the door.</p>

<p>"No, Xenie," she said, abruptly, "Lora is not worse&mdash;she
is better. Are you awake? Do you know what I am
saying? Lora has a beautiful son."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, it was but a minute ago that I went out on
the veranda."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear. It was several hours ago. You have
been asleep a long time. It is nearly midnight."</p>

<p>"And Lora really has a son, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Xenie: the finest little fellow I ever saw."</p>

<p>"You promised to call me if she became worse and you
needed me," said Mrs. St. John, reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not need you, dear. I did everything for Lora
my own self," said Mrs. Carroll, with a sort of tender pride
in her voice.</p>

<p>"And she is doing well? I may see her&mdash;and the baby&mdash;my
little son!" exclaimed Xenie, with a sudden ring of triumph
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is doing well; a little flighty now and then,
and very weak; she could not bear the least excitement.
But you shall go to her in a minute. She wished it."</p>

<p>They went into the dimly-lighted, quiet room, and Xenie
kissed her sister and cried over her very softly. Then she
took the bundle of warm flannel out of Lora's arms and uncovered
a red and wrinkled little face.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, you said it was beautiful," she said, disappointedly;
"and I am bound to confess that, to me, it
looks like a very old and wrinkled little man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll laughed very softly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you ever met with a very young baby
before, my dear," she said. "I assure you he is quite handsome
for his age, and he will improve marvelously in a
week's time."</p>

<p>Xenie stood still, holding the babe very close and tight in
her arms, while a dazzling smile of triumph parted her beautiful
scarlet lips. She hated to lay it down, for while she
held it warm and living against her breast she seemed to
taste the full sweetness of the wild revenge she had planned
against her enemy.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, Lora," she cried, "how impatiently I have
waited for this hour! And now I am so glad, so glad! We
will go home soon, now&mdash;as soon as our darling is well
enough to travel&mdash;and then I shall triumph to the uttermost
over Howard Templeton."</p>

<p>She kissed the little pink face tenderly and exultantly two
or three times, then laid him back half-reluctantly on his
mother's impatient arm.</p>

<p>"He is my little son," she whispered, gently; "for you
are going to give him to me, aren't you, Lora?"</p>

<p>A weary sigh drifted over the white lips of the beautiful
young mother.</p>

<p>"I will lend him to you, Xenie, for I have promised," she
murmured; "but, oh, my sister, does it not seem cruel and
wrong to take such an innocent little angel as that for the
instrument of revenge?"</p>

<p>Xenie drew back, silent and offended.</p>

<p>"Xenie, darling, don't be angry," pleaded Lora's weak
and faltering tones; "I will keep my promise. You shall
call him yours, and the world shall believe it. He shall
even call you mother, but you must let me be near him always&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
must let him love me a little, dear, because I am
his own dear mother."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, then added, in faint accents:</p>

<p>"And, Xenie, you will call him Jack&mdash;for his father's
sake, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," Xenie answered, tenderly, melted out of
her momentary resentment by the pathos of Lora's looks
and words, "it shall all be as you wish. I only wish to call
him mine before the world, you know. I would not take
him wholly from you, my little sister."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks," murmured Lora, feebly, then she
put up her white arm and drew Xenie's face down to hers.</p>

<p>"I have been dreaming, dear," she said. "It seemed to
me in my dream as if my poor Jack were not dead after all.
It seemed to me he escaped from the terrible fire and shipwreck,
and came back to me brave and handsome, and loving,
as of old. It seems so real to me even now that I feel
as though I could go out and almost lay my hand upon my
poor boy's head. Ah, Xenie, if it only could be so!"</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John looked across at her mother, and Mrs. Carroll
shook her head warningly. Then she said aloud, in a
soothing tone:</p>

<p>"These are but sick fancies, dear. You must not think
of Jack any more to-night, but of your pretty babe."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma is quite proud of her little grandson already,"
said Xenie, with tender archness.</p>

<p>"Mamma, shall you really love the little lad? You were
so angry at first," Lora said, falteringly.</p>

<p>"That is all over with now, my daughter. I shall love my
little grandson as dearly as I love his mother, soon," replied
Mrs. Carroll; "but now, love, I cannot allow you to talk
any longer. Excitement is not good for you. Run away
to bed, Xenie. We do not need you to-night."</p>

<p>"Let me stay and share your vigil," pleaded Xenie.</p>

<p>"No, it is my turn to-night. Last night you sat up, you
know. I will steal a little rest upon the lounge when Lora
gets composed to sleep again."</p>

<p>Xenie went away to her room and threw herself across
the bed, dressed as she was, believing that she was too excited
to go to sleep again.</p>

<p>But a gradual drowsiness stole over her tumultuous
thoughts, and she was soon wrapped in a troubled, dreamful
slumber.</p>

<p>Daylight was glimmering faintly into the room, when
Mrs. Carroll rushed in, pale and terrified, and shook her
daughter wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Xenie, wake, wake, for God's sake!" she cried, in
the wildest accents of despair and terror. "Such a terrible,
terrible thing has happened to Lora!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>Xenie sprang to her feet, broad awake at those fearful
words.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" she gasped, in terror-stricken accents,
"what is it? My sister&mdash;is she worse? Is she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She thought of death, but she paused, and could not bring
her lips to frame that terrible word, and stood waiting
speechlessly, with parted lips and frightened, dark eyes,
for her mother to speak.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Carroll, as if that one anguished sentence had
exhausted all her powers, fell forward across the bed, her
face growing purple, her lips apart in a frantic struggle for
breath.</p>

<p>Xenie hurriedly caught up a pitcher of water standing
near at hand, and dashed it into her convulsed face, with
the quick result of seeing her shiver, gasp, and spring up
again.</p>

<p>"Mamma, speak!" she cried, shaking her wildly by the
arm; "what has happened to you? What has happened to
Lora?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll's eyes, full of a dumb, agonizing terror,
turned upon Xenie's wild, white face.</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but the words died chokingly in her
throat, and she lifted her hand and pointed toward the
door.</p>

<p>Instantly Xenie turned, and rushed from the room.</p>

<p>As she crossed the narrow hallway a breath of the fresh,
chilly morning air blew across her face. The door that
Mrs. Carroll had securely locked the night before was
standing wide open, and the wind from the sea was blowing
coolly in.</p>

<p>With a terrible foreboding of some impending calamity,
Xenie sprang through the open doorway of Lora's room,
and ran to the bed.</p>

<p>Oh! horrors, the bed was empty!</p>

<p>The beautiful young mother and the little babe, the day-star
of Xenie's bright hopes, were gone!</p>

<p>Xenie looked around her wildly, but the pretty little
chamber was silent and tenantless.</p>

<p>With a cry of fear and dread commingled, she rushed toward
the door, and encountered her mother creeping slowly
in, like a pallid ghost, in the chilly, glimmering dawn of
the new day.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, where is Lora?" she cried, in a faint voice,
while her limbs seemed to totter beneath her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll shook her head, and put her hands to her
throat, while her pallid features seemed to work with convulsive
emotion. The terrible shock she had sustained
seemed to have stricken her dumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, mamma, cannot you speak? Cannot you
tell me?" implored her daughter.</p>

<p>But by signs and gestures Mrs. Carroll made her understand
that the terrible constriction in her throat made it
impossible for her to utter a word.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. St. John stood still, like a silent statue
of despair, but with a sudden inspiration she brought writing
materials, placed them on a small table, and said to her
mother:</p>

<p>"Sit down, mamma, and write what you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll's anguished face brightened at the suggestion.
She sat down quickly at the little table, and drawing a
sheet of paper toward her, dipped the pen into the ink, and
began to write.</p>

<p>Xenie leaned over her shoulder, and watched eagerly for
the words that were forming beneath her hand.</p>

<p>But, alas, the nervous shock her mother had sustained
made her hand tremble like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>Great, sprawling, blotted, inky characters soon covered
the fair sheet thickly, but among them all there was not
one legible word.</p>

<p>Xenie groaned aloud in her terrible impatience and pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, try again!" she wailed. "Write slowly
and carefully. Rest your arm upon the table, and let your
hand move slowly&mdash;very slowly."</p>

<p>And with an impotent moan, Mrs. Carroll took another
sheet of paper and tried to subdue her trembling hands to
the task for whose fulfillment her daughter was waiting so
anxiously.</p>

<p>But again the blotted characters were wholly illegible.
No effort of the mother's will could still the nervous, trembling
hands, and render legible the anguished words she
laboriously traced upon the paper.</p>

<p>She sighed hopelessly as her daughter shook her head.</p>

<p>"Never mind, mamma," she said, "let it go, you are
too nervous to form a single letter legibly. I will ask you
some questions instead, and you will bow when your
answer should be affirmation, and shake your head to indicate
the negative."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll gave the required token of assent to this
proposition.</p>

<p>"Very well. Now I will ask you the first question," said
Xenie, trying to subdue her quivering voice into calm accents.
"Mamma, did Lora go to sleep after I left you together?"</p>

<p>A shake of the head negatived the question.</p>

<p>"She was restless and flighty, then, perhaps, still dwelling
on her dream about her husband?"</p>

<p>This question received an affirmative answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"But after awhile she became composed and fell asleep&mdash;did
she not?" continued Mrs. St. John.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll bowed, her lips moving continually in a
vain and yearning effort after words.</p>

<p>"And then you lay down upon the lounge to snatch a
few minutes of repose?" asserted Xenie.</p>

<p>Again she received an affirmative reply.</p>

<p>"Mamma, did you sleep long?" was the next question.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll shook her head with great energy.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, of course you did not!" exclaimed Xenie,
quickly, "for it was midnight when I left you, and if Lora
was wakeful and restless it must have been several hours
before either one fell asleep. And it is not daylight yet, so
you must have slept a very little while. Were you
awakened by any noise, mamma?"</p>

<p>The question was instantly negatived.</p>

<p>"You were nervous and ill at ease, then, and simply
awoke of yourself?" continued Mrs. St. John, anxiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll's earnest, dark eyes said yes almost as
plainly as her bowed head.</p>

<p>"And when you woke, Lora and the babe were gone,
mamma, and the front door stood wide open&mdash;is that the
way of it, mamma?" continued Xenie, anxiously watching
her mother's face for the confirmation of her question.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll gave assent to it while a hoarse wail of anguish
issued from her drawn, white lips.</p>

<p>Xenie echoed the wail, and for a moment her white face
was hidden in her hands while the most terrible apprehension
stabbed her to the heart.</p>

<p>Then she looked up and said quickly:</p>

<p>"She must have wandered away in a momentary fit of
flightiness&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>And again Mrs. Carroll gave a quick motion of assent.</p>

<p>"Then I must find her, mamma," said Xenie, quickly.
"She cannot have gone very far. She was too weak to get
away from us unless&mdash;&mdash; Oh! my God! she cannot have
gone to the water!" moaned Xenie, clasping her hands in
horror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll looked as if she were going into a fit at the
bare suggestion.</p>

<p>Her face turned purple again, her eyes stared wildly, she
clutched at her throat like one choking.</p>

<p>Xenie forced her back upon the lounge, applied restoratives,
then exclaimed wildly:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I cannot bear to leave you thus, but I must
go and seek for my sister. Even now she may be perishing
in reach of our hands. Ninon, the maid, will be here
in a little while. She will care for you, and I will bring
back my poor little Lora."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>She kissed her mother's face as she spoke, then hurried
out, shawlless and bare-headed, into the chill morning air.</p>

<p>It was a dark and gloomy dawn, with a drizzle of rain
falling steadily through the murky atmosphere.</p>

<p>A fine, white mist was drawn over the sea like a winding
sheet. The sun had not tried to rise over the dismal
prospect.</p>

<p>Xenie ran heedlessly down the veranda steps, and bent
her steps to the seashore, looking about her carefully as she
went, and calling frantically all the time:</p>

<p>"Lora, Lora, Lora! Where are you, my darling? Where
are you?"</p>

<p>But no answer came to her wild appeal.</p>

<p>The soft, low patter of the steady rain, and the solemn
sound of the waves as they madly surged upon the shore,
seemed like a funeral requiem in her ears.</p>

<p>She could not bear the awful voice of the sea, for she remembered
that Lora had hated it because her husband was
buried in its illimitable waves.</p>

<p>But suddenly a faint and startling sound came to her
ears.</p>

<p>She thought it was the moan of the wind rising at first,
then it sounded again almost at her feet&mdash;the shrill, sharp
wail of an infant.</p>

<p>Xenie turned around and saw, not twenty paces from
her, a little bundle of soft, white flannel lying upon the wet
sand.</p>

<p>She ran forward with a scream of joy, and picked it up
in her arms, and drew aside one corner of the little embroidered
blanket.</p>

<p>Joy, joy! it was Lora's baby&mdash;Lora's baby, lying forlorn
and deserted on the wet sand with the hungry waves rolling
ever nearer and nearer toward it, as though eager to
draw it down in their cold and fatal embrace.</p>

<p>With a low murmur of joy, Xenie kissed the cold little
face and folded it closely in her arms.</p>

<p>"Lora cannot be very far now," she thought, her heart
beating wildly with joy. "She was so weak the babe has
slipped from her arms, and she did not know it. She will
come back directly to find it."</p>

<p>She ran along the shore, looking through the gray dawn
light everywhere for her sister, and calling aloud in tender
accents:</p>

<p>"Lora, Lora, my darling!"</p>

<p>But suddenly, as she looked, she saw a strangely familiar
form coming toward her along the sand.</p>

<p>It was a man clothed in a gray tweed traveling suit, such
as tourists wear abroad.</p>

<p>He stopped with a cry of surprise as they met, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
on the wild shores of France, with the rain beating down
on her bare head and thin dress, with Lora's baby tightly
clasped in her bare arms, Xenie St. John found herself face
to face with her enemy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Like one stricken motionless by terror, she stood still and
looked up into the proud face and scornful blue eyes of the
man she had thought far, far away beneath the skies of his
native land.</p>

<p>The ground seemed slipping from beneath her feet, the
wild elements seemed whirling aimlessly over her head;
she forgot Lora, she forgot the child that nestled against
her breast; she remembered nothing else but her enemy's
presence and the deadly peril to which her secret was exposed.</p>

<p>"Howard Templeton," she panted forth wildly, "why are
you here?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. St. John," he returned, with a bitter smile, "I
might rather ask you that question. What are <i>you</i> doing
here in this stormy dawn, with your bare head and
your thin slippers and evening dress? Permit me to
offer you my cloak. Do you forget that it is cold and
rainy, that you court certain death for yourself and the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused without ending the sentence and looked at the
little white bundle lying helpless in her arms, and a steely
gleam of hatred flared into his eyes.</p>

<p>"The child," she said, finishing the sentence for him with
a passionate quiver of joy in her voice, "<i>my</i> child&mdash;Howard
Templeton&mdash;the little one that has come to me to avenge
his mother's wrongs. Look at him. This is your uncle's
heir, this tiny little babe! He will strip you of every dollar
you now hold so unjustly, and his mother's revenge
will then be complete."</p>

<p>She turned back a corner of the blanket, and gave him a
glimpse of the little pink face, and the babe set up a feeble
and pitiful little wail.</p>

<p>It was as though the unconscious little creature repeated
its mother's plaintive remonstrance against making such
an innocent little angel the instrument for consummating a
cruel revenge.</p>

<p>But Xenie was deaf to the voice of conscience, or she
might have fancied that its accusing voice spoke loudly in
the wail of the little babe.</p>

<p>She looked at Howard Templeton with a glow of triumph
in her face, her black eyes shining like stars.</p>

<p>The wind and the rain tossed her dark, loosened ringlets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
about her, making her look like some mad creature with
that wicked glow of anger and revenge in her beautiful,
spirited face.</p>

<p>"Say, is it not a glorious revenge?" she cried. "You
scorned me because I was poor. I was young, I was fair,
I was loving and true, but all that counted for nothing in
your eyes. For lack of gold you left me. Did you think
my heart would break in silence? Ah, no, I swore to give
you back pang for pang, and I have taken from you all
that your base heart ever held dear&mdash;gold, shining gold.
Through me you will be stripped of all. Is it not a brilliant
victory? Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>His blue eyes flashed down into her vivid, black ones,
giving her hate for hate and scorn for scorn. In a low,
concentrated voice, he said:</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid to taunt me thus? Look there at
that seething ocean beneath its shroud of mist. Do you see
that no one is near? Do you know that there is no one in
hearing? Suppose I should take you up with your revenge
in your arms and cast you into yonder sea? The opportunity
is mine, the temptation is great."</p>

<p>"Yet you will not do it," she answered, giving him a
glance of superb scorn.</p>

<p>"Why do you say I will not do it?" he asked; "why
should I spare you? You have not spared me! You are
trying to wrest my inheritance from me. We are sworn
and deadly foes. I have nothing to lose by your death,
everything to gain. Why should I not take the present opportunity
and sweep you from my path forever?"</p>

<p>He paused and looked down at her in passionate wrath
while he wondered what she would say to all this; but she
was silent.</p>

<p>"Again I ask you why should I spare you?" he repeated;
"are you not afraid of my vengeance, Xenie St. John?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not afraid," she repeated, defiantly, yet even
as she spoke he saw that a shudder that was not of the
morning's cold shook her graceful form. A sudden consciousness
of the truth that lurked in his words had rushed
over her.</p>

<p>"Yes, we <i>are</i> deadly foes," she repeated to herself, with
a deeper consciousness of the meaning of those words than
she had ever had before. "Why should he spare me, since
I am wholly in his power?"</p>

<p>His voice broke in suddenly on her swift, tumultuous
thoughts, making her start with its cold abruptness.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see that you begin to realize your position," he
said, icily. "What is your revenge worth now in this moment
of your deadly peril? Is it dearer to you than your
life?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is dearer to me than my life," she answered,
steadily. "If nothing but my life would buy revenge for me
I would give it freely!"</p>

<p>He regarded her a moment with a proud, silent scorn.
She returned the gaze with interest, but even in her passionate
anger and hatred she could not help owning to her
secret heart that she had never seen him looking so handsome
as he did just then in the rough but well-fitting tweed
suit, with the glow of the morning on his fair face, and that
light of scorn in his dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>"Well, go your way, Xenie St. John. You are in my
way, but it is not by this means I will remove you from it. I
am not a murderer&mdash;your life is safe from my vengeance.
Yet I warn you not to go further in your wild scheme of
vengeance against me. It can only result in disaster to
yourself. I am forewarned of your intentions and your
wicked plot. You can never wrest from me the inheritance
that Uncle John intended for me!"</p>

<p>"We shall see!" she answered, with bold defiance, undaunted
by his threatening words.</p>

<p>Then, as the little babe in her arms began to moan pitifully
again, she remembered the dreadful trouble that had
sent her out into the rain, and turning from him with a
sudden wail of grief, she began to run along the shore, looking
wildly around for some trace of the lost one.</p>

<p>She heard Howard's footsteps behind her, and redoubled
her speed, but in a minute his hand fell on her shoulder, arresting
her flight. He spoke hastily:</p>

<p>"I heard you calling for Lora before I met you&mdash;speak,
tell me if she also is wandering out here like a madwoman,
and why?"</p>

<p>She turned on him fiercely.</p>

<p>"What does it matter to you, Howard Templeton?"</p>

<p>"If she is lost I can help you to find her," he retorted.
"What can you do? A frail woman wandering in the rain
with a helpless babe in your arms!"</p>

<p>Bitterly as she hated him, an overpowering sense of the
truth of his words rushed over her.</p>

<p>She hated that he should help her and yet she could not
let her own angry scruples stand in the way of finding
Lora.</p>

<p>She looked up at him and the hot tears brimmed over in
her black eyes and splashed upon her white cheeks.</p>

<p>"Lora is missing," she answered, in a broken voice. "She
has been ill, and last night she wandered in her mind. This
morning while mamma and I slept she must have stolen
away in her delirium. Mamma was prostrated by the
shock, and I came out alone to find her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should have left the child at home. It will perish
in the rain and cold," he said, looking at her keenly.</p>

<p>She shivered and grew white as death, but pressed the
babe closer to her breast that the warmth of her own heart
might protect its tender life.</p>

<p>"Why did you bring the child?" he persisted, still watching
her keenly.</p>

<p>"I will not tell you," she answered, defiantly, but with a
little shiver of dread. What if he had seen her when she
found it on the sands?</p>

<p>"Very well; you shall not stay out longer with it, at
least. Granted that we are deadly foes&mdash;still I have a man's
heart in my breast. I would not willingly see a woman
perish. Go home, Xenie, and care for your mother. I will
undertake the search for Lora. If I find her you shall know
it immediately. I promise you."</p>

<p>He took the heavy cloak from his own shoulders and fastened
it around her shivering form.</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice the action, but stood still mechanically,
her dark, tearful eyes fixed on the mist-crowned
sea. He followed her gaze, and said in a quick tone of
horror:</p>

<p>"You do not believe she is in there? It would be too
horrible!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" Mrs. St. John groaned, with a quiver of
awful dread in her voice.</p>

<p>He shivered through all his strong, lithe young frame.
The thought of such a death was terrible to him.</p>

<p>"You said she was ill and delirious?" he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she wailed.</p>

<p>"Poor Lora&mdash;poor little Lora!" he exclaimed, with a sudden
tone of pity. "Alas! is it not too probable that she
has met her death in those fatal waves?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she could not, she could not," Xenie moaned, wildly.
"She hated the sea. Her lover was drowned in it.
She could not bear the sight or the sound of it."</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment. He was looking away
from her with a great, solemn dread and pity in his beautiful,
blue eyes. Suddenly he said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"Go home, Mrs. St. John, and stay there until you hear
news. I will go and arouse the village. I will have help in
the search, and if she is found we will bring her home. If
she is not, God help you, for I fear she has drowned herself
in the sea."</p>

<p>With a long, moaning cry of anguish, Xenie turned from
him and sped along the wet sand back to her mother.
Howard Templeton watched the flying figure on its way
with a grave trouble in his handsome face, and when she
was out of sight, he turned in an opposite direction and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
walked briskly along the sand, looking carefully in every
direction.</p>

<p>"They talk of judgment," he muttered. "Has God sent
this dreadful thing upon Xenie St. John for her sinful
plans? If it is so, surely it will bring her to repentance.
In the face of such a terrible affliction, she must
surely be afraid to persist in attempting such a stupendous
fraud."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Half dead with weariness and sorrow, Mrs. St. John
staggered into her mother's presence with the wailing infant
in her arms.</p>

<p>She sank down upon the floor by the side of the
couch and laid the child on her mother's breast, moaning
out:</p>

<p>"I found him down there, lying on the wet sand all alone,
mamma&mdash;all alone! Oh! Lora, Lora!"</p>

<p>A heart-rending moan broke from Mrs. Carroll's lips.
Her face was gray and death-like in the chill morning
light.</p>

<p>She closed her arms around the babe and strained it fondly
to her breast.</p>

<p>"Mamma, are you better? Can you speak yet? I have
much to tell you," said Xenie, anxiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll made a violent effort at articulation, then
shook her head, despairingly.</p>

<p>"I will send for the doctor as soon as the maid returns.
She cannot be long now&mdash;it is almost broad daylight,"
said Xenie, with a heavy sigh. "And in the meantime
I will feed the babe. It is cold and hungry. Mamma,
shall I give it a little milk and water, warmed and sweetened?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll assented, and Xenie went out into the little
kitchen, lighted a fire and prepared the infant's simple
nourishment.</p>

<p>Returning to Lora's room, she sat down in a low rocker,
took the child in her arms, and carefully fed it from a teaspoon,
first removing the cold blanket from around it, and
wrapping it in warm, dry flannels.</p>

<p>Its fretful wails soon ceased under her tender care, and it
fell into a gentle slumber on her breast.</p>

<p>"Now, mamma," she said, as she rocked the little sleeper
gently to and fro, "I will tell you what happened to me
while I was searching for my sister."</p>

<p>In as few words as possible, she narrated her meeting with
Howard Templeton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll greeted the information with a groan. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was both astonished and frightened at his appearance
in France, when they had supposed him safe in America.</p>

<p>She struggled for speech so violently that the dreadful
hysteric constriction in her throat gave way before
her mental anguish, and incoherent words burst from her
lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Xenie, he will know all now, and Lora's good name
and your own scheme of revenge will be equally and forever
blasted! All is lost!"</p>

<p>"No, no, mamma, that shall never be! He shall not find
us out. I swear it!" exclaimed her daughter passionately.
"Let him peep and pry as he will, he shall not learn anything
that he could prove. We have managed too cleverly
for that."</p>

<p>And then the next moment she cried out:</p>

<p>"But, oh, mamma, you are better&mdash;you can speak
again!"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank Heaven!" breathed Mrs. Carroll, though she
articulated with difficulty, and her voice was hoarse and
indistinct. "But, Xenie, what could have brought Howard
Templeton here? Can he suspect anything? Did he know
that we were here?"</p>

<p>Xenie was silent for a moment, then she said, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"It may be that he vaguely suspects something wrong.
Indeed, from some words he used to me, I believe he did.
But what then? It is perfectly impossible that he could
prove any charge he might make, so it matters little
what he suspects. Oh, mamma, you should have seen
how black, how stormy he looked when I showed him
the child, and told him it was mine. I should have felt
so happy then had it not been for my fear and dread over
Lora."</p>

<p>"My poor girl&mdash;my poor Lora!" wailed the stricken
mother. "Oh, Xenie, I am afraid she has cast herself into
the sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, do not believe it. She did not, she could not!
You know how she hated the sea. She has but wandered
away, following her wild fancy of finding her husband.
She was too weak to go far. They will soon find her and
bring her back," said Xenie, trying to whisper comfort to
the bereaved heart of the mother, though her own lay
heavy as lead in her breast.</p>

<p>She rose after a moment and went to the window.</p>

<p>"It is strange that Ninon does not return to get the
breakfast," she said, looking out. "Can her mother be
worse, do you think, mamma?"</p>

<p>"She may be, but I hardly think it likely. She was better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of the fever the last time Ninon went to see her. It is
likely that the foggy, rainy morning has deceived her as to
the lateness of the hour. She will be along presently, no
doubt," said Mrs. Carroll, carelessly; for her trouble rendered
her quite indifferent to her bodily comfort.</p>

<p>Xenie sat down again, and rocked the babe silently for a
little while.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, how impatient I grow!" she said, at
length. "It seems to me I cannot wait longer. I must put
the child down and go out again. I cannot bear this dreadful
suspense."</p>

<p>"No, no; I will go myself," said Mrs. Carroll, struggling
up feebly from the lounge. "You are cold and wet now,
my darling. You will get your death out there in the rain.
I must not lose both my darlings at once."</p>

<p>But Xenie pushed her back again with gentle force.</p>

<p>"No, mamma, you shall not go&mdash;you are already ill," she
said. "Let the child lie in your arms, and I will go to the
door and see if anyone is coming."</p>

<p>Filled with alternate dread and hope, she went to the
door and looked out.</p>

<p>No, there was naught to be seen but the rain and the mist&mdash;nothing
to be heard but the hollow moan of the ocean, or
the shrill, piping voice of the sea birds skimming across
the waves.</p>

<p>"It is strange that the maid does not come," she said
again, oppressed with the loneliness and brooding terror
around her.</p>

<p>She sat down again, and waited impatiently for what
seemed a considerable time; then she sprang up restlessly.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I will just walk out a very little way," she
said. "I must see if anyone is coming yet."</p>

<p>"You must not go far, then, Xenie." Mrs. Carroll remonstrated.</p>

<p>Xenie dashed out into the rain again, and ran recklessly
along the path, looking far ahead of her as if to pierce the
mystery that lay beyond her.</p>

<p>Presently she saw a young French girl plodding along
toward her.</p>

<p>It was Ninon, the belated maid. Over her arm she carried
a dripping-wet shawl.</p>

<p>It was a pretty shawl, of warm woolen, finely woven,
and striped with broad bars of white and red.</p>

<p>Xenie knew it instantly, and a cry of terror broke from
her lips. It belonged to Lora.</p>

<p>She had seen it lying around her sister's shoulders when
she kissed her good-night; yet here it hung on Ninon's
arms, wet and dripping, the thick, rich fringes all matted
with seaweed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>Xenie's heart beat so fast at the sight of what Ninon was
carrying that she could not move another step.</p>

<p>She had to stand still with her hands clasped over her
throbbing side and wait till the girl came up to her.
Then:</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, Ninon, where did you get that?" she gasped,
looking at the shawl with eyes full of horror, yet afraid to
touch it, for it seemed like some dead thing.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'amselle," faltered the girl stopping short and
looking at Xenie's anguished face. "Oh, ma'amselle," she
faltered again, and her pretty, piquant face grew white and
her black eyes sought the ground, for Ninon, although poor
and lowly, had a very tender heart, and she could not bear
to see the anguish in the eyes of her young mistress.</p>

<p>"I asked you where did you get that shawl?" Xenie repeated.
"It was my sister's shawl. She wore it last night,
and now, to-day, she is missing. Did you know that,
Ninon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl answered, in her pretty, broken English.
She had heard it. A gentleman, a tourist, had brought the
news to the village, and the men were all out looking for
her.</p>

<p>Would her mistress come to the house? She had something
to tell her, but not out there in the cold and wet. She
looked fit to drop, indeed she did, declared the voluble,
young French girl.</p>

<p>So she half-led, half-dragged Mrs. St. John back to the
cottage and into the room where the stricken mother was
waiting for tidings of her lost one.</p>

<p>The maid had a sorrowful story to tell.</p>

<p>The waves had cast a dead body up on the beach an hour
ago&mdash;the corpse of a woman, thinly dressed in white, with
long, beautiful black hair flowing loosely and tangled with
seaweed.</p>

<p>They could not tell who she was, for&mdash;and here Ninon
shuddered visibly&mdash;the rough waves had battered and
swollen her features utterly beyond recognition.</p>

<p>But they thought that she was young, for her limbs were
white and round, and beautifully moulded, and this shawl
which Ninon carried had been tightly fastened about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The maid had recognized it and brought it with her to
show the bereaved mother and sister, and to ask if they
wished to go and view the body and try to identify it.</p>

<p>All this the maid told sorrowfully and hesitatingly, while
the two women sat like statues and listened to her, every
vestige of hope dying out of their hearts at the pitiful story,
and at length Xenie cast herself down upon the wet shawl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and wept and wailed over it as though it had been the dead
body of poor Lora herself lying there all wet and dripping
with the ocean spray before her anguished sight.</p>

<p>Then Ninon begged her to listen to what she had to say
further.</p>

<p>"The gentleman is going to send a vehicle for you that
you may go and see the body, if you wish&mdash;I can hear the
roll of the wheels now! Shall I help you to get ready?"</p>

<p>Xenie looked at her mother with a dumb inquiry on her
beautiful, pallid features.</p>

<p>"Yes, go, dear, if you can bear it. Perhaps, after all, it
may not be our darling," said Mrs. Carroll, with a heavy
sigh, even while she tried to cheat her heart by the doubt
which she felt to be a vain one.</p>

<p>So, with Ninon's aid, Xenie changed her wet and drabbled
garments for a plain, black silk dress, and a black hat
and thick veil.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the maid to take care of her mother, Mrs.
St. John entered the vehicle and was driven to the place
where a group of excited villagers kept watch over a ghastly
something upon the sand&mdash;the mutilated semblance of a
human being that the cruel sea had beaten and buffeted beyond
recognition.</p>

<p>It was a terrible ordeal for that young, beautiful, and loving
sister to pass alone.</p>

<p>As she stepped from the vehicle with a wildly-beating
heart before the curious scrutiny of the strangers around
her, she involuntarily cast a glance around her in the vague,
scarce-defined belief that Howard Templeton would be upon
the scene. But, no, there was no sign of his presence.</p>

<p>Strangers advanced to lead her forward; strangers questioned
her; strangers drew back the sheet that had been
reverently folded over the dead, and showed her that ghastly
form that all believed must have been her sister.</p>

<p>She knelt down, trying to keep back her sobs, and looked
at the form lying there in the awful majesty of death, with
the cold, drizzling rain beating down on its swollen, discolored
features.</p>

<p>How could that awful thing be Lora&mdash;her own, beautiful,
tender Lora?</p>

<p>And yet, and yet, that beautiful, long, black hair&mdash;that
fine, embroidered night-robe, hanging in tattered remnants
now where the sea had rent it&mdash;did they not belong to her
sister? Sickening with an awful dread, she touched one of
the cold, white hands.</p>

<p>It was a ghastly object now, swollen and livid, yet you
could see that once it had been a beautiful hand, delicate,
dimpled, tapering.</p>

<p>And on the slender, third finger, deeply imbedded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
swollen flesh, were two rings&mdash;plain, broad, gold bands.
Xenie's eyes fell upon them, and with a wild, despairing
cry, "Oh, Lora, my sister!" she fell upon the wet sand, in
a deep and death-like swoon.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>After leaving Xenie on the seashore, Howard Templeton
walked away hurriedly to the little fishing village, a
mile distant, and gave the alarm of Lora's disappearance.</p>

<p>By a promise of large rewards, he speedily induced a party
of men to set out in separate directions to scour the adjacent
country for the wanderer.</p>

<p>But scarcely had they set out on their mission when someone
brought to Howard the news of the corpse that old
ocean had cast upon the sands.</p>

<p>Dreading, yet fully expecting to behold the dead body
of Lora Carroll, Howard Templeton turned back and accompanied
the man to the scene.</p>

<p>They found a group of excited men and women gathered,
on the shore, drawn thither by that nameless fascination
which the dreadful and mysterious always possesses for
every class of minds whether high or low.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in the group was Ninon, the pretty young
maid-servant, and, as Howard came upon the scene, she
was volubly explaining to the bystanders that the shawl
which was tightly pinned about the shoulders of the dead
woman belonged to the missing girl for whom the men had
gone out to search.</p>

<p>Was she quite sure of it, they asked her. Yes, she was
quite sure.</p>

<p>She had seen it night after night lying across the bed in
the young lady's sleeping-apartment.</p>

<p>When she was ill and restless, as often happened, she would
put it around her shoulders and walk up and down the
room for hours, weeping and wringing her hands like one in
sore distress.</p>

<p>"Yes," Ninon said, she could swear to the shawl. She
would take it home with her and show it to her mistress,
and they would see that she was right.</p>

<p>No one interfered to prevent her.</p>

<p>With an irrepressible shudder at touching the dead, the
girl drew out the pins and took the wet shawl.</p>

<p>Then, as she started on her homeward way, Howard
Templeton, who had stood still like one in a dream of horror,
started forward and told her that he himself would
send a vehicle for the ladies, that they might come if they
wished to identify the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>For himself, he had no idea whether or not that the poor,
bruised and battered corpse could be Lora Carroll.</p>

<p>He could see nothing that reminded him of her except
the beautiful, black hair lying about her head in heavy,
clinging masses, sodden with water and tangled with seaweed.</p>

<p>He longed, yet dreaded, for Mrs. Carroll and her daughter
to arrive and confirm or dissipate his fears and end the
dreadful suspense.</p>

<p>And yet, with the rumble of the departing wheels of the
conveyance he had sent for them, a sudden cowardice stole
over the young man's heart.</p>

<p>He could not bear the thought of the anguish of which he
might soon be the witness.</p>

<p>Obeying a sudden, inexplicable impulse, he turned from
the little company of watchers by the dead and walked off
from them, taking the course along the shore that led away
from the little village.</p>

<p>Oftentimes those simple little impulses that seem to us
mere accidental happenings, would appear in reality to be
the actual fulfillment of some divine design.</p>

<p>Howard little dreamed, as he turned away with a kind of
sick horror, that was no shame to his manhood, from the
sight of so much misery, that "a spirit in his feet" was
guiding him straight to the living Lora, even while his heart
foreboded that it was she who lay cold and lifeless on the
ocean shore.</p>

<p>Yet so it was. True it is, as the great bard expresses it,
that "there's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew
them as we will."</p>

<p>Howard hurried along aimlessly, his thoughts so busy on
one painful theme that he took no note of where he was
going, or how fast he went.</p>

<p>He was a rapid walker usually, and when he at length
brought himself to a sudden abrupt stop he realized with a
start that he had come several miles at least.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, the sun had come out in all its majestic
glory, and beneath its fervid kisses the mist that hid
the ocean was melting into thin air.</p>

<p>It bade fair to be a beautiful day, after all.</p>

<p>The pearly rain-drops sparkled like diamonds on the
leaves and flowers, the sky was blue and beautiful,
with here and there a little white cloud sailing softly
past.</p>

<p>The day had began like many a life, in clouds and tears,
but it promised to close in as fair and sweet a serenity as
many an early-shadowed life has done.</p>

<p>Howard involuntarily thought of the poet's beautiful
lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be still, sad heart, and cease repining,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Behind the clouds is the sun still shining!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Days of sunshine are given to all,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though into each life some rain must fall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He paused and looked around him. He found that he
had come into the outskirts of another rude, little fishing
village.</p>

<p>A little ahead of him he could see the fishers bustling
about on the shore.</p>

<p>"I have come four miles, at least," he said to himself.
"What a great, hulking, cowardly fellow I am to run that
far from a woman's tears. Far better have stayed and
tried to dry them. Um! She wouldn't have let me," he
added, with a rueful second thought.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's idle gazing out at sea, aimlessly
noting the flash of a sea-gull's wing as it wheeled in the blue
air above him, he said, resolutely:</p>

<p>"I'll go back, anyhow. Perhaps I can do something to
help them. They are but women&mdash;my countrywomen,
too, and I'll not desert them in their trouble, even though
<i>she</i> does hate me."</p>

<p>He turned around suddenly to return, and the fate that
was watching him to prevent such a thing, placed a simple
stone in the way. He stepped upon it heedlessly, his ankle
turned, and, with a sharp cry of pain, Howard fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>He made an effort to rise, but the acute pains that suddenly
darted through his ankle caused him to fall back upon
the wet sand in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Umph! my ankle is evidently master of the situation,"
he thought, with an expression of comical distress.</p>

<p>Raising himself on his elbow, he shouted aloud to the men
in the distance, and presently two of them came running
to his assistance.</p>

<p>"I have sprained my ankle," he explained to them in their
native tongue. "Please assist me to rise, and I will try to
walk."</p>

<p>But when they took him by the arms and raised him up,
they found that it was impossible for him to walk.</p>

<p>"This is a deuced bore at the present time, certainly,"
complained the sufferer. "Can you get me any kind of a
trap to drive me back to the village yonder?"</p>

<p>The peasants looked at him stupidly, and informed him
carelessly that there was nothing of the kind available.
Only one man in the vicinity owned a horse, and it had
sickened and died a week before.</p>

<p>Howard felt a great and exceeding temptation to swear a
very small oath at this crisis, but being too much of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
gentleman to yield to this wicked whisper of the evil one,
groaned very loudly instead.</p>

<p>"Then what the deuce am I to do?" he inquired, as much
of himself as of the two fishermen. "How am I to get
away from this spot of wet sand? Where am I to go?"</p>

<p>The peasants scrutinized him as stupidly as before, and
to all of these questions answered flatly that they did not
know, indeed.</p>

<p>Howard thought within himself that the proverbial politeness
of the French was greatly tempered by stupidity in
this case.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he inquired next, "is there any kind of
a hotel around here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there was such a place," they informed him, readily;
and Howard at once begged them to summon aid and
construct a litter for him, promising to reward them liberally
if they would carry him to the hotel.</p>

<p>Gold&mdash;that magic "open sesame" to every heart&mdash;procured
him ready and willing attention.</p>

<p>It was but a short while before he found himself in tolerably
comfortable quarters at the rude hotel of the fishing
village, and obsequiously waited upon by the single Esculapius
the place afforded.</p>

<p>Howard's sprain was pronounced very severe indeed. It
was so painful that he could not walk upon it at all, and
was ordered to strict confinement to his couch for three
days.</p>

<p>"A fine prospect, by Jove!" Howard commented, discontentedly.
"What am I to do shut up here three days
in solitary confinement? and what will those poor women
do over yonder with not a single masculine soul to turn to
in their helplessness? Not that they wish my help, of
course, but I had meant to offer it to them all the same if
there was anything I could have done," he added, grimly,
to his own self.</p>

<p>The three days dragged away very drearily. On the
fourth day Howard availed himself of the aid of a crutch
and got into the little public room of the hotel.</p>

<p>Among the few idlers that were gathered about in
little friendly groups, he saw a rather intelligent-looking
fisherman going from one to another with a small slip of
paper in his hand.</p>

<p>As they read it some shook their heads, and some dived
into their pockets and brought forth a few pence, which
they dropped into the fisherman's extended palm.</p>

<p>Howard was quite curious by the time his turn came.
He took the paper in his hand and found it to be an humble
petition for charity, which duly set forth:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, an unknown woman lies ill of a fever at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
house of one Fanchette Videlet, a poor widow, almost without
the necessaries of life, it is here begged by the said
widow that all Christian souls will contribute a mite to the
end of securing medical attendance and comforts for the
poor unknown wayfarer."</p>

<p>This petition, which was written in excellent French, and
duly signed Fanchette Videlet, had a strange effect upon
Howard Templeton. His face grew pale as death; his eyes
stared at the poor fisherman in perplexed thought, while he
absently plunged his hand into his pocket and drew it out
full of gold pieces.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Here, my man, take this," he said, putting the coins
into the man's hand.</p>

<p>"Why, this is too much, sir," said the honest fisherman,
holding his hand out and looking at the gold in surprise.
"You will rob yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"No, no; keep it. It is but a trifle," said Howard, pushing
his hand back. "But, pray, will you answer a few
questions for me?"</p>

<p>"As many as you like, sir&mdash;and thank you for your generosity,"
answered the fisherman, politely.</p>

<p>"I am very much interested in the sad story written
here," said Howard, glancing at the paper which he still
held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it is very sad," assented the fisherman.</p>

<p>"How came this unknown sick woman at the Widow
Videlet's house?" inquired Howard.</p>

<p>"The poor soul came there a few days ago, sir. She
was ill and quite out of her head&mdash;could give no account
of herself."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what day she came there?"</p>

<p>"This makes the fourth day since she came, sir. I remember
it was the same day you were brought to the
hotel."</p>

<p>The young man started. It was the same day that Lora
Carroll had disappeared.</p>

<p>Could it be Lora? Had it been some other waif the great
sea had cast up from its deep?</p>

<p>"Did you see this woman? Could you describe her to
me?" asked Howard, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I saw her the day she came wandering into Dame Videlet's
cottage," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You can tell me how she looked then," said Howard,
restraining his impatience by a great effort.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She was a mere girl in appearance&mdash;very
young and very beautiful, with black eyes and long, black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hair. She was thinly clad in a fine night-dress," answered
the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Did you say she was out of her mind?" asked Howard.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she raved continually."</p>

<p>"What form did her delirium take?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," cried the fisherman, in a tone of pity and sympathy
for the wretched unknown, "it seemed like she had
lost her baby. She was going around from one to the other
in the place asking, asking everyone, for her baby. She
said she was so tired and she had lost it out of her arms in
the rain and the darkness, and could not find it again."</p>

<p>Howard's heart gave a great, tumultuous bound of surprise,
then almost stopped beating with the suddenness of
the shock.</p>

<p>It all rushed over him with the suddenness of a revelation.</p>

<p>It had seemed so strange to him that Mrs. St. John should
have taken the tender little babe with her in the rain and
wind when she went to search for Lora.</p>

<p>The truth flashed over him like lightning now.</p>

<p>Xenie had found the babe upon the sand where Lora had
dropped it in her fevered flight.</p>

<p>No wonder she had been so angry and defiant when he
had questioned her about it.</p>

<p>He felt sure now, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the
unknown sick woman in the poor widow's cottage could be
none other than Lora herself.</p>

<p>"Poor, unhappy creature," he thought, with a thrill of
commiseration. "It must be that God himself has sent
me here to succor and befriend her."</p>

<p>He rose hurriedly and took up his crutch.</p>

<p>"How far is Dame Videlet's cottage from here?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"But a few rods, sir&mdash;a little further on toward the
beach," said the fisherman, regarding him in some surprise.</p>

<p>"I will go down there and see that unfortunate woman,
if you will guide me," said Howard. "I believe that she is
a friend of mine. You may return their pence to those poor
fishermen, who can ill spare it, perhaps. I will charge myself
with her expenses even if she should not prove to be
the person I think she is."</p>

<p>The fisherman looked at him admiringly and hastened to
do his bidding.</p>

<p>Then they walked along to the widow's cottage very
slowly, for Howard found himself exceedingly awkward
in the use of his crutch.</p>

<p>But after all it seemed but a very few minutes before
they stood in the one poor little room of Dame Videlet's dilapidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
cot bowing to the kind old soul who had taken
the poor wayfarer in beneath the shelter of her lowly roof,
shared her simple crust with her, and tended her with
kindly, Christian hands.</p>

<p>"How is your patient to-day, my kind woman?" inquired
the young man.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, ah, sir, you may even see for yourself," she
answered sadly, as she turned toward the bed.</p>

<p>Howard went forward with a quickened heart-beat, and
stood by her side looking down at the sufferer.</p>

<p>Yes there she lay&mdash;poor little Lora&mdash;with wide, unrecognizing,
black eyes, with cheeks crimson with fever and
parted lips through which the breath came pantingly. A
heavy sigh broke unconsciously from Howard's lips.</p>

<p>"Good sir, do you know her?" asked the woman, regarding
him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her," he answered; "she is a friend of
mine and has wandered away from her home in the delirium
of fever. You shall be richly rewarded for your noble
care of her."</p>

<p>"I ask no reward but the blessing of Heaven, sir," said
the good old woman, piously; "I have done the best I could
for her ever since she staggered into the door and asked me
for her lost baby."</p>

<p>As if the word struck some sensitive chord in her consciousness,
Lora turned her wild, bright eyes upon Howard's
face, and murmured in a pathetic whisper:</p>

<p>"Have you found my baby&mdash;Jack's baby and mine?"</p>

<p>Alas for Xenie's secret, guarded with such patient care
and sleepless vigilance.</p>

<p>Howard looked down upon her with a mist of tears before
his sight&mdash;she looked so fair, and young, and sorrowful,
lying there calling for her lost little child.</p>

<p>"I have lost my baby, I have lost my baby!" she wailed
aloud, throwing her arms wildly over her head and tangling
her fingers in the long, dark tresses floating over the pillow
in their beautiful luxuriance. "It is lost, lost, lost, my darling
little one! It will perish in the rain and the cold!"</p>

<p>Involuntarily Howard reached out and took one of the
restless white hands in his, and held it in a firm and tender
clasp.</p>

<p>"Lora, Lora," he said, in a gentle, persuasive voice,
"listen to me. The baby is <i>found</i>. Xenie found it on the
shore where you lost it out of your arms. It is safe&mdash;it is
well, with Xenie."</p>

<p>Lora turned her hollow glance upon his face, and though
no gleam of recognition shone in her eyes, his impressive
words penetrated her soul. She threw out her arms yearningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is found, it is found! Oh, thank God!" she murmured,
happily. "Bring him to me, for the love of Heaven!
Lay him here upon my breast, my precious little son!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, then it is true she had a child; and it is living. I
thought perhaps it was dead," said the poor widow.</p>

<p>"She has a child, indeed, and she lost it in her delirious
flight; but her sister found it soon afterward. It is at this
moment not more than four miles from here," answered
the young man, without reflecting that many things might
have happened during his long imprisonment of four days
in the lonely little fishing village.</p>

<p>"Then, if you will take my advice, sir, as she is a friend
of yours, you will try to get that child here as soon as possible.
I will do the best I can for her, and the doctor has
promised to do all in his power; but I believe that the child
is the only thing that will save her life," said Dame Videlet,
gravely shaking her head in its homely white cap.</p>

<p>"It shall be brought," said Howard, earnestly, and
without a doubt but that he could keep the promise thus
made.</p>

<p>Dame Videlet thanked God aloud, then added that the
sooner it were brought the better it would be for the
mother.</p>

<p>All the while poor Lora lay tossing in restless pain, and
begging piteously for her little child to be laid upon her
breast.</p>

<p>Howard bent over her as tenderly and gently as a
brother.</p>

<p>"Lora, my poor child, try to be patient," he said. "I
will bring the child to you; only be patient a little while."</p>

<p>But it was all in vain to preach patience to that racked
heart and weary, fevered brain.</p>

<p>He stole away, followed by despairing cries for the little
child&mdash;cries that echoed in his heart and brain many days
afterward, when his warm heart was half-broken because he
could not keep the promise he had made in such perfect confidence
and hope.</p>

<p>"How shall I get back to the village four miles away
from here?" he asked of the man who had accompanied him
and was still waiting for him.</p>

<p>"I can take you in my fishing-boat and row you there,
and welcome, sir," was the hearty response. "It's a wee
bit leaky, but as good as any other craft about, and there's
no conveyance to be had by land."</p>

<p>"What a great simpleton I have been, by George, never
to have thought of a boat before," said Howard, looking
vexed at himself. "Here I have been four days, and wanting
to get back to the village badly, and never thought of
all the little boats and the great, wide ocean."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mayhap it's all for the best, sir," said the fisherman.
"If you had gone back sooner, you might never have found
the sick lady, your friend. You should see the hand of the
Lord in it, my young sir."</p>

<p>"It looks like it," admitted Howard, "though, truth to
tell, <i>mon ami</i>, I do not usually look for such intervention in
my affairs. His Satanic Majesty is at present controlling
my mundane affairs."</p>

<p>"The Lord rules, sir," answered the man, launching his
little boat, and trying to make a comfortable and dry seat
for his crippled young passenger.</p>

<p>The little boat shot out into the blue and sparkling waves,
and danced along like a thing of life in the beautiful spring
sunshine.</p>

<p>"We must go a mile below the village to the home of my
friend's mother," Howard explained, as they went along.</p>

<p>Then he fell to wondering how Xenie would receive him
when he came to her with the glad tidings of Lora's discovery.</p>

<p>"How strange that I should carry <i>her glad</i> tidings," he
thought. "I am afraid I do not keep to the letter of my
vow of hatred as firmly as she does. Would <i>she</i> bring me
good news as willingly?"</p>

<p>His heart answered no.</p>

<p>The keel grated on the shore, and springing out, they
went up to the pretty cottage were Mrs. Carroll had lived
in strict retirement for several months with her two
daughters.</p>

<p>But there a terrible disappointment awaited Howard.</p>

<p>The cottage was untenanted.</p>

<p>They knocked several times, eliciting no response, and
finally opening the doors, they found that the occupants
had moved out.</p>

<p>All was still and silent, and Howard's heart sank heavily
as he thought of poor Lora lying in the widow's cot and
moaning for the child he had promised to bring her.</p>

<p>"They are gone away," said Howard in a more hopeless
voice than he knew himself. "We must return to the village.
We may hear news from them there."</p>

<p>And in his heart he was fervently praying that he
would, for how could he return to Lora without the child?</p>

<p>They went to the little village where the dead body had
been washed upon the sands, and he asked everyone he
met if they knew where the occupants of the little cottage
had gone.</p>

<p>No one could tell him anything of their whereabouts.
They had identified the drowned woman as their relative,
had buried her, and then quietly left the place, taking Ninon,
the little maid, with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not obtain the least clew by which he might follow
them and bring them back to the sick girl whom they
mourned as dead.</p>

<p>Howard did not know what to do now, for he remembered
that Dame Videlet had said that the child was the
only thing that could save Lora's life.</p>

<p>He went into the churchyard and looked at the new-made
grave with the cross of white marble, and the simple
inscription "Lora, <i>tat</i> 18."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the inscription might come true after all in a
few&mdash;a very few days," he thought, sadly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>Howard did not know what to do: it seemed such a terrible
thing to go back to Lora with bad tidings. Perhaps
the shock would kill her.</p>

<p>Oh, if Mrs. St. John had but waited a little longer! Why
need she have hurried away so precipitately?</p>

<p>Well, there was no help for it.</p>

<p>He must go back and tell her how inopportunely things
had turned out, and how sorry he was that he could not
keep his promise.</p>

<p>He would get Dame Videlet to break it to her very gently.</p>

<p>She would not bungle over it like a great, awkward fellow
like himself.</p>

<p>The good old woman was waiting for him outside the
door.</p>

<p>Her face was radiant, but it changed and grew very anxious
as he came up to her, and she saw that his arms were
empty.</p>

<p>"Where is the child?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Briefly and sadly he told the story of his disappointment,
and the widow wiped the tears of sorrow from her eyes as
he concluded.</p>

<p>"How is she now?" he inquired, anxiously.</p>

<p>"She has been better, much better, since you told her the
child was found. Her reason has returned to her, and
she has wept tears of joy. She is impatiently waiting for
you now, for I told her just now that you were returning.
Alas, alas!" groaned Dame Videlet, her tender heart quite
melted by the thought of Lora's disappointment.</p>

<p>Howard groaned in unison with her.</p>

<p>"Will it go hard with her?" he asked, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>The dame shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>"Alas, alas!" she groaned again.</p>

<p>"You will break the news to her&mdash;will you not?" asked
Howard. "It would be better for you to do it; I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
great, awkward fellow, and could not tell her tenderly and
gently like a woman. Tell her we will try to find her
mother and sister as soon as possible. Do not let her despair."</p>

<p>"I will tell her," said the good woman, turning toward
the door, "but I am afraid the disappointment will nearly
kill her. She is very ill. She cannot bear much. Do you
remain outside while I go in."</p>

<p>Howard sat down on a rough bench outside the door and
waited, his heart heavy with grief for the poor, unfortunate
girl within.</p>

<p>"Far better that I had not seen her at all, than have given
her such hope only to be followed by disappointment," he
thought sadly to himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild, piercing, delirious shriek issued from
the widow's cot, causing him to spring up in alarm, and
rush into the room.</p>

<p>He met the bereaved mother in the center of the floor,
trying to make her escape from the feeble arms of Dame
Videlet who was drawing her back to the bed.</p>

<p>She looked like a mad creature struggling with the weak,
old woman, her dark hair flying loose in wild confusion, her
arms flung upward over her head, while shriek after shriek
burst from her foam-flecked lips.</p>

<p>"Take her," cried the old woman, excitedly. "Hold her
tightly in your arms a minute."</p>

<p>Howard obeyed her quickly, and in his strong, yet gentle
clasp, the mad girl was held securely while Dame Videlet
poured something from a bottle upon a sponge and held it to
the girl's dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>Directly her wild cries grew fainter, her eyelids fell, her
head dropped heavily upon Howard's breast.</p>

<p>"Lay her down upon the bed, now, sir," said the dame,
"and fetch the doctor as quickly as you can. This delirium
will soon return upon her. The effect of the drug
will not last very long."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"She cannot live the night out," said the doctor, sadly.</p>

<p>Three weary days and nights had Lora been tossing restlessly
in the delirium of fever. Everything that money or
skill could do had been done for her, but all to no avail.</p>

<p>Now, as they stood around the bed and listened to her
wild, delirious ravings, the kind old doctor shook his
head and sighed at the sight of so much youth and beauty
going down to the grave.</p>

<p>"She cannot live the night out," he said again, in a voice
of deep feeling.</p>

<p>"Can nothing more be done?" asked Howard Templeton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his blue eyes resting sadly on the wreck of the beautiful
Lora.</p>

<p>"I have done all that the medical art can do," declared
the physician, "but all to no avail. She has sustained a
terrible shock. Her dreadful tramp through the wind and
rain the day she came here was enough to have killed her.
But her constitution was a superb one, and I believed that
I might have saved her after all, if the child could have
been restored to her."</p>

<p>"Why did we not think of procuring a substitute for the
child?" exclaimed Howard, suddenly. "If we could have
put another child in its place might not the innocent deception
have saved her life?"</p>

<p>"Such a plan might have been tried," said the doctor,
thoughtfully. "But it must have been a terrible risk to
tell her the truth even after her recovery. She is very
nervous, and her organization is high-strung."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the grayness and pallor of death settled
over Lora's beautiful, wasted features.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>"My love, you are simply perfect. You look like a
bride."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll spoke enthusiastically, and her daughter
flushed brightly with gratified pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>She was standing before the long cheval-glass in her
dressing-room. She was about to attend a ball at Mrs.
Egerton's, and her maid had just put the finishing touches
to her toilet.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Mrs. Carroll's admiration had
broken out into enthusiastic words. Xenie's loveliness was
dazzling, her toilet perfection.</p>

<p>She wore a dress of the rarest and costliest cream-white
lace over a robe of cream-colored satin. The frosty network
of the over-dress was looped here and there with
diamond stars.</p>

<p>A necklace of diamonds was clasped around her white
throat, a diamond star twinkled in the dark waves of her
luxuriant hair, and the same rich jewels shone on her
breast and at her tiny, shell-like ears.</p>

<p>Her dark and brilliant beauty shone forth regally from
the costly setting.</p>

<p>Her eyes outrivaled the diamonds, her satin skin was as
creamily fair as her satin robe, her scarlet lips were like
rosebuds touched with dew.</p>

<p>No wonder that Mrs. Carroll caught her breath in a kind
of ecstacy at the resplendent vision.</p>

<p>More than a year had passed since that dark and rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
morn on the shores of France, when Xenie had wandered
up and down on the "sea-beat shore" seeking her lost
sister&mdash;a year that had brought its inevitable changes, and
dulled the first sharp edge of grief&mdash;so that to-night she
was to throw off her mourning robes and reappear in society
for the first time at a ball given by her aunt, Mrs. Egerton.</p>

<p>Yet, after that first moment of exultant triumph at her
mother's praise, a faint, intangible shadow settled over
Mrs. St. John's brilliant face.</p>

<p>The scarlet lips took a graver curve upon their honeyed
sweetness, the dark, curling lashes drooped low, until they
shaded the peachy cheek.</p>

<p>The white-gloved hand that held the rare bouquet
drooped wearily at her side.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, abruptly, "I wish I had not promised
to go."</p>

<p>"What has come over you, Xenie? I thought you had
looked forward to this night with real pleasure."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;I do, mamma, and yet for the moment my heart
grew sad. I was thinking of poor little Lora."</p>

<p>A hot tear splashed down upon her cheek, and Mrs.
Carroll sighed heavily, while her grave, sad face grew
sadder and graver still. She put her hand upon her
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, that we might have her back!" she breathed, in a
voice that was almost a moan of pain.</p>

<p>"The carriage is waiting, madam," said Finette, appearing
at the door.</p>

<p>"Well, I am ready," said Mrs. St. John, listlessly. "My
cloak, Finette."</p>

<p>The maid came forward and threw the elegant wrap about
her shoulders, and leaving a light kiss on her mother's lips,
Mrs. St. John swept out of the dressing-room and down to
the carriage that waited to take her to the brilliant <i>fete</i> that
Mrs. Egerton had planned in her especial honor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll bent her steps to the nursery.</p>

<p>Ninon, the little French nurse, sat beside the hearth sewing
on a bit of fancy work, and the soft glow of firelight
and gaslight shining upon her made her look like a quaint,
pretty picture in her neat costume and dark prettiness.</p>

<p>The nursery was a dainty, airy, white-hung chamber. It
had been a smoking-room in Mr. St. John's time. His widow
had converted it into a nursery.</p>

<p>In a beautiful rosewood, lace-draped crib lay the spurious
heir to the millionaire's wealth&mdash;a beautiful, rosy healthy
boy, sleeping softly and sweetly in innocent unconsciousness
of the terrible fraud that had been perpetrated in his
name.</p>

<p>For Mrs. St. John's daring scheme had succeeded. Lora's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
child had been foisted upon the law and the world as the
millionaire's legal heir, and Howard Templeton's heritage
had passed into the hands of the child's guardian, Mrs. St.
John, his pretended mother.</p>

<p>But, alas! in the hour of her triumph, when the golden
fruit of her wild revenge was within her grasp, its sweetness
had palled upon her, its taste had been bitter to her
lips. It was but Dead Sea fruit, after all.</p>

<p>For the struggle with Howard Templeton for the possession
of the millionaire's fortune which Xenie had anticipated
with such passionate zest had been no struggle after
all.</p>

<p>In a few weeks after the burial of the poor drowned
woman whom she had identified as her sister, Xenie
and her mother had returned to the United States, taking
with them Lora's child, and as nurse, Ninon, the little
maid-servant.</p>

<p>A costly bribe had sealed the lips of the little French
maid, and the truth of the little boy's parentage was a dead
secret with her.</p>

<p>Immediately after her arrival at home, Xenie had placed
her case in the hand of a noted lawyer.</p>

<p>He undertook it in perfect faith. He did not dream that
he had been employed as the necessary aid to carry out
a wicked scheme of revenge and perpetrate a gigantic
fraud.</p>

<p>He took immediate steps to regain the possession of the
deceased millionaire's property in the interest of his posthumous
child.</p>

<p>The case immediately attracted public attention and interest,
both from the high position of the parties to the suit
and the great wealth involved.</p>

<p>But for several months nothing could be heard from the
defendant, who was still absent in Europe, although the
lawyer who managed his property in his native city wrote
him frantic and repeated appeals to return and defend his
case.</p>

<p>At length, when patience had ceased to be a virtue with
the plaintiff, and the opposition was about to push the suit
for judgments without him, a brief letter was received from
Howard Templeton, instructing the lawyers to postpone
everything until after his arrival.</p>

<p>He would sail on a certain day and upon a certain steamer,
and be with them four weeks from date.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John was quite content to wait after she heard
of that letter.</p>

<p>She felt so sure that she would win that she was willing
to wait until her enemy came. She wanted to triumph over
him face to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>So the weeks dragged by, and Howard's steamer was due
in port.</p>

<p>It did not come. Soon it was a week over-due.</p>

<p>Then came one of those dreadful reports of marine disasters
that now and then thrill the great heart of humanity
with horror.</p>

<p>There had been a terrible storm at sea, and the ship had
gone to pieces upon a hidden rock. Only seven persons had
been saved.</p>

<p>Howard Templeton's name appeared in the list of passengers
who had perished.</p>

<p>So there could be no further delay now. The case went
before the courts and was very speedily decided.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John gained the case and had her revenge.</p>

<p>But it was no revenge, after all, since Howard Templeton
was not alive to pay the bitter cost of her vengeance.</p>

<p>So the golden fruit, bought at the price of her soul's
peace, turned to bitter ashes on her loathing lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>"Mrs. St. John, allow me to present to you Lord Dudley."</p>

<p>Xenie turned with a languid smile and bowed to the tall,
elegant gentleman who bent admiringly before her.</p>

<p>Only ten minutes before Mrs. Egerton had whispered to
her eagerly:</p>

<p>"My dear, Lord Dudley, the great English peer, is present.
There's a catch for you."</p>

<p>"I am not looking for a catch," Xenie said, almost
bruskly.</p>

<p>"No," said her aunt, who was an indefatigable matchmaker;
"but then you are too young and beautiful to
remain always single. You are sure to marry some day
again, and why not Lord Dudley?"</p>

<p>"He has not asked me, aunt," said Xenie, half-smiling,
half-provoked. "I am not even acquainted with him."</p>

<p>"No, but you will be," said Mrs. Egerton. "I heard him
asking just now about you. He said you were the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen&mdash;a compliment worth
having from such a man as Lord Dudley, so elegant and
distinguished, with such an air of culture and travel. Besides,
he is so wealthy, owning several castles in England,
I'm told, and a fabulous bank account."</p>

<p>"A distinguished <i>parti</i>, certainly," said Xenie, indifferently,
and then, as her aunt moved away, she completely
forgot Lord Dudley's existence.</p>

<p>She stood leaning carelessly against a tall flower-stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
looking at the dancers, a little later, when Mrs. Egerton approached,
leaning on the arm of a handsome gentleman, and
then she found herself bowing and smiling in acknowledgement
of an introduction to Lord Dudley.</p>

<p>"I have been watching you a long time, Mrs. St. John,"
he said, taking his place by her side. "Your face puzzled
me."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she said, raising her dark eyes to him with a
kind of languid wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," he said. Then suddenly, as the intoxicating
strains of a waltz began to pulsate on the perfumed
air, he exclaimed, in a different tone: "Will you give me
this waltz, Mrs. St. John?"</p>

<p>She assented indifferently, and a moment later she was
whirling down the long room, the envy of every woman at
the ball, for every feminine present had set her cap at the
distinguished traveler.</p>

<p>His tall, proud form in the black evening dress showed
to the most perfect advantage, as clasping her <i>petite</i> and
graceful form closely in his arm, they whirled round and
round to the enchanting strains, looking, in the perfect accord
and gracefulness with which they moved, like the
spirit of harmony embodied.</p>

<p>"That will be a match," predicted some of the wiseacres
around, and those that did not say that much thought it to
themselves.</p>

<p>Among the latter class was a gentleman who had entered
a moment before and now stood talking courteously to the
hostess.</p>

<p>It was she who had directed his attention to the handsome
pair.</p>

<p>"Look at Xenie," she said with a spice of malicious
triumph in her tone. "That is Lord Dudley with whom
she is waltzing. She has quite captivated him. Doubtless
it will be a match."</p>

<p>His eyes followed the flying form a moment steadily,
then he answered calmly:</p>

<p>"They are a handsome pair, certainly, Mrs. Egerton. I
am acquainted with Lord Dudley."</p>

<p>"You met him abroad, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, we came over from England in the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at that moment someone came hastily up and claimed
his attention.</p>

<p>Then a little excited group formed around him, and even
the waltzers began to see that an unusual interest was agitating
the wall-flowers.</p>

<p>Xenie looked carelessly at first, then more closely as she
saw that her aunt stood in the center of the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Egerton has suddenly become the center of attraction,"
she said, laughingly, to her companion.</p>

<p>Then she started and the room seemed to swim around
her, the lights, the flowers, the black suits of the men, the
gay, butterfly robes of the women seemed to be blending in
an inextricable maze.</p>

<p>Her heart seemed beating in her ears, so loudly it
sounded.</p>

<p>She had caught a flitting glimpse of a man's form standing
just beyond her aunt. It was he around whom the excited
little throng buzzed and eddied.</p>

<p>He was tall, straight, graceful as a young palm tree,
handsome as Apollo, in his elegant evening dress.</p>

<p>His head, crowned with fair, curling locks, was held
aloft with half-haughty grace; his Grecian profile, clearly-cut
as a cameo head, was turned toward Xenie, and she
saw the smile that curved the fair, mustached lips, the flash
in the proud, blue eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment she lost the step, and hung droopingly on
her partner's arm.</p>

<p>"You are tired," he said, stopping and looking down into
her deathly-white face. "Pardon me, I kept you on
the floor too long; but your step was so perfect, the music
so entrancing, I forgot myself."</p>

<p>He was leading her to a seat as he spoke. She came back
to herself with a quick start.</p>

<p>"No, do not blame yourself," she answered. "The fact
is I am not accustomed to waltzing of late. This is the
first time for almost two years, and it is so easy to&mdash;to
grow dizzy&mdash;to lose one's head."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, it is," he answered. "Shall I get you a
glass of water?"</p>

<p>"If you please," she murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>He went away, and she tried to rally from her sudden
shock.</p>

<p>By the time he returned she was calm, nonchalantly fanning
herself with a languid, indolent grace. No one but
herself knew how hard and fast her heart was beating yet.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured; then, as she lifted her
head, she saw her aunt coming to her, leaning on the arm
of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Lord Dudley stared and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Heaven! it is Howard Templeton! The sea has given
up its dead!"</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked Xenie.</p>

<p>"Yes, we crossed together. That is&mdash;until the terrible
storm that wrecked us&mdash;I was one of the seven that were
saved. It was supposed that Templeton was lost."</p>

<p>"Xenie," said Mrs. Egerton, vivaciously, and yet with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
note of warning in her tones that was distinguishable only
to her ears for whom it was intended, "here is an old friend
whom we all thought dead. Bid him welcome."</p>

<p>Xenie arose, languid, careless, pale as a ghost, yet wearing
a gracious smile for the eyes of the little social world
that watched her keenly.</p>

<p>He took the half-extended hand in his a moment, and
bowed low over it, touching it an instant to his mustached
lips.</p>

<p>"I kiss the hand that smites me," he murmured in her
ear, sarcastically; then turned aside to greet Lord Dudley.</p>

<p>Fervent congratulations were exchanged between these
two, who had been ocean voyagers together, and who had
parted on the deck of the broken vessel, expecting to meet
again only upon the other shore of eternity.</p>

<p>"I am dying of impatience to hear how you were rescued
from the horrors of that terrible shipwreck," said Lord
Dudley. "Is the story too long to tell us to-night?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story, but it may be told in a few words,"
said Howard. "I was tossed about for some time, clinging
desperately to a slender spar, then picked up by a blockade
runner bound for Cuba.</p>

<p>"This, in turn, was captured by a Spanish war vessel. I
remained a prisoner of Spain until such time as the vessel
put into port, and I reported to our American consul in
that country.</p>

<p>"He immediately wrote to America for the necessary
papers to prove my identity as a citizen of America. These
being obtained and examined, I was released, after a tedious
delay, and came home as fast as wind and tide could carry
me. There, my lord, you have the whole story in a nutshell."</p>

<p>"And a very interesting one, too, I doubt not, had it been
related in detail. I heartily rejoice that you were saved to
tell it," said Lord Dudley, with interest.</p>

<p>Then he added, as if some afterthought had suddenly
struck him:</p>

<p>"And, Templeton, the lady&mdash;who came over in your care&mdash;was
she also saved?"</p>

<p>Templeton started, and flashed a hurried glance at Xenie.</p>

<p>She was toying with her jeweled fan, and looking away
as carelessly as if she had forgotten his existence.</p>

<p>He did not know that she was listening intently to every
word.</p>

<p>He looked back carelessly at the nobleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was rescued with me. We clung to the spar
together. I would have lost my own life rather than that
frail and helpless girl should have perished!"</p>

<p>"She returned with you, then?" said Lord Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she returned in my care. She was a helpless young
widow," said Howard, evasively. "She lost all her friends
in Europe."</p>

<p>Then other friends claimed him, and he turned away.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Templeton is an old acquaintance of yours, Mrs.
St. John?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he was my late husband's nephew," she answered,
with languid indifference.</p>

<p>He saw that she did not care to pursue the subject.</p>

<p>"It puzzled me when I first saw you to-night that I could
not account for the strange familiarity of your face," he
said; "but since I have so unexpectedly met with my fellow-voyager,
Howard Templeton, I distinctly recall the
reason. You are singularly like a lady who traveled in his
care&mdash;your very height, your very features; though, as I
remember now, very different in expression. She appeared
almost heart-broken; yet she was very beautiful. I need
not tell you that, though, since I have already said she
looks like you," he added, with an admiring bow.</p>

<p>"What was her name?" asked Mrs. St. John, eagerly,
quite oblivious of the delicate compliment.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten it," said Lord Dudley. "Forgetting
names is a weakness of mine. Yet I remember that Templeton
called her by her Christian name&mdash;a very soft and
sweet one. Let me see&mdash;<i>Laura</i>, perhaps."</p>

<p>Xenie sat silent and thoughtful. There was a strange
pain at her heart. She could not understand it.</p>

<p>"It cannot be that I am sorry he is living," she said to
herself. "My triumph is greater than if he were dead. He
knows that I have my sweet revenge. It was never sweet
until I knew him living to feel its pangs! For all his
haughty bearing it must be that he feels it in all its bitterness."</p>

<p>Then a sudden irrelevant thought flashed across these
self-congratulations.</p>

<p>"I wonder who that Laura can be? Is he in love with
her?"</p>

<p>It was the most natural thought in the world for a
woman; yet she put it away from her with a sort of angry
impatience.</p>

<p>"What if he does love her?" she thought, scornfully,
"He cannot marry her. He is a beggar. I have stripped
him of everything. She will leave him for lack of gold, as
he left me. Then he may feel something of what I suffered
through his sin!"</p>

<p>And she felt gladder than ever before at the thought of
Howard Templeton's poverty. She knew that he could not
marry the girl for whom he said he would have lost his own
life&mdash;that beautiful, mysterious <i>Laura</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Egerton was passing and she called her.</p>

<p>"I am going home," she said. "I have danced too much.
I am tired, and the rooms are suffocating."</p>

<p>"A multiplicity of excuses," laughed Lord Dudley.
"Ossa upon Pelion piled. Mrs. St. John, you will not be so
cruel?"</p>

<p>"I must; my head aches," she replied; and though he
pleaded and Mrs. Egerton protested, she was obstinate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Egerton saw her depart, feeling sorely vexed with
her.</p>

<p>Howard Templeton saw her leaving, and crossed the room
to her.</p>

<p>"I shall do myself the pleasure of calling upon you to-morrow,"
he said, quietly, as he lightly touched her hand.</p>

<p>They had to wear a mask, these two deadly foes, before
the curious eyes of the world.</p>

<p>She flashed a sudden, haughty look of inquiry into his
steadfast eyes.</p>

<p>He stooped over her quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he whispered, hurriedly and lowly; "it is <i>vendetta</i>
still. War to the knife!"</p>

<p>Then Lord Dudley, full of regrets, attended her to her
carriage.</p>

<p>"Xenie, is that you? Are you just home from the ball?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll turned sleepily on her pillow and looked at
the little figure that came gliding in, looking ghost-like in
the pale glimmer of the night-lamp in its trailing white
robes and unbound hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, it is I. But I have been home several
hours from the ball."</p>

<p>"And not asleep yet, dear?" said Mrs. Carroll, in mild
surprise.</p>

<p>"No; I am so restless I cannot sleep. I am sorry I had
to disturb you, mamma, but I came to ask you to give me
some simple sleeping potion."</p>

<p>"Certainly, love; but wouldn't it be wiser to try and
sleep without it? Did you try counting backward?"</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke and turned up the gas. Mrs. St.
John laughed&mdash;a short, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, I tried all the usual old-woman
remedies, but to no avail. My brain is too excited to yield
to trifling measures. Give me something strong that will
induce sleep directly."</p>

<p>Her mother, looking at her keenly, saw that she was very
pale, and her wide-open, dark eyes looked heavy with some
speechless pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear, you are not ill, are you?" she inquired, going to
a little medicine-case and taking out a small vial and wineglass.</p>

<p>"No, mamma, only nervous and restless. Give me the
opiate. It is all I need."</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy the ball?" asked her mother, pouring out
the drops with a steady hand. "Who was there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a number of people. Lord Dudley, for instance.
You remember we visited his castle while we were abroad&mdash;that
great show-place down in Cornwall. I did not tell
him about it, though. He is very handsome and elegant.
Aunt Egerton recommended him to me as a most desireable
catch."</p>

<p>She wanted to tell her mother that the sea had given up
its dead&mdash;that she had seen Howard Templeton alive and
in the flesh, but somehow she could not bring herself to
utter his name; so she had rattled on at random.</p>

<p>"Humph! I should think Mrs. Egerton had had enough
of making matches for you," her mother muttered.
"After the way Howard Templeton treated you she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," said Xenie, interrupting her suddenly.</p>

<p>"What?" said Mrs. Carroll.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he is here," said Xenie, with a gasp.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;who, child?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"The man you named," said Xenie, in a low voice, as
she took the wineglass into her shaking hand.</p>

<p>"Not Howard Templeton?" said Mrs. Carroll, with such
an air of blank astonishment that she looked almost ludicrous
in her wide-frilled, white night-cap, and Xenie must
have laughed if it had not been for that strange and heavy
aching at her heart. As it was, she simply said:</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"Then he wasn't shipwrecked, after all&mdash;I mean he
wasn't drowned, after all. Somebody saved him, didn't
they?" said Mrs. Carroll, in a good deal of astonishment.</p>

<p>And again Xenie said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"But how did it all happen? Or did you ask him?" inquired
her mother, curiously.</p>

<p>"He is coming here to-morrow. I dare say he will tell
you all about it. I am going now. Good-night," said Xenie,
draining the contents of the wineglass and setting it
down.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my darling," said Mrs. Carroll, looking after
her a little disappointedly as she went slowly from the
room.</p>

<p>But Xenie did not look back, though she knew that her
mother was burning with curiosity to know more of her
meeting with Howard Templeton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>She went to her luxurious room, crept shiveringly beneath
the satin counterpane, and was soon lost to all mundane
interest in the deep sleep induced by the drug she had
taken.</p>

<p>She slept long and uninterruptedly, and it was far into
the day when she awoke and found her maid, Finette, waiting
patiently to dress her.</p>

<p>"You must arrange my hair very carefully, Finette," she
said, as the maid brushed out the dark luxuriance of her
tresses, "and put on my handsomest morning-dress. I expect
a caller this morning."</p>

<p>It always pleased her to appear at her very fairest in
Howard Templeton's presence.</p>

<p>She liked for him to realize all he had lost when he gave
her back her troth because she was poor, and because
he was not manly enough to dare the ills of poverty for her
sake.</p>

<p>So Finette arranged the silky, shining, dark hair in a soft
mass of waves and puffs that did not look too elaborate for
a morning toilet, and yet was exquisitely becoming, while
it gave a certain proud stateliness to the <i>petite</i> figure.</p>

<p>Then she added a little comb of frosted silver, and laid out
several morning-dresses of various hues and styles for the
inspection of her mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John looked them over very critically.</p>

<p>It was a spring morning, but the genial airs of that balmy
season had not yet made their appearance sufficiently for
an indulgence in the crisp muslin robes that suited the
month, so Xenie selected a morning-robe of pale-pink cashmere,
richly trimmed in quilted satin and yellowish Languedoc
lace.</p>

<p>The soft, rich color atoned for the unusual absence of
tinting in the oval fairness of her face, and when she descended
to the drawing-room she had never looked lovelier.</p>

<p>The slight air of restless expectancy about her was not
enough to detract from her beauty, though it robbed her of
repose.</p>

<p>"Mamma, has little Jack come in yet from his morning
airing?" she inquired of Mrs. Carroll, who was sorting some
bright-colored wools on a sofa.</p>

<p>"Yes, half an hour ago. You slept late," said Mrs. Carroll.</p>

<p>"Let us have him in to amuse us," said Mrs. St. John,
restlessly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll rang a bell and a servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Tell Ninon to bring my son here," said Mrs. St. John.</p>

<p>Presently the little French maid appeared, leading the
beautiful, richly-dressed child by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Jack rushed forward tumultuously and climbed
into Xenie's lap. She kissed him fondly but carefully, taking
care that he did not disarrange her hair or dress.</p>

<p>"Pretty mamma," whispered the dark-eyed child, patting
her pale cheeks with his dimpled, white hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John smiled proudly, and just then her mother
said, with the air of one who vaguely recalls something:</p>

<p>"Did I dream it last night, Xenie, or did you tell me
that Mr. Templeton is alive, and that he is coming here to-day?"</p>

<p>There came a sudden hurried peal at the door-bell. Xenie
started, growing white and red by turns.</p>

<p>"I told you so," she answered. "And there he is now, I
suppose."</p>

<p>She sat very still and waited, clasping the beautiful boy
to her wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>There was a bustle in the hall, then the door was thrown
open and a gentleman was ushered in.</p>

<p>He was a large, handsome young man, in the uniform of
a sea captain. He wore a large, dark beard, and his brown
eyes flashed their eagle gaze around the room, half-anxiously,
half-defiantly, until they rested on Mrs. St. John's face
where she sat clasping the child in her arms.</p>

<p>As she met his gaze she put the child down upon the floor
and started up with a low cry.</p>

<p>"<i>Jack Mainwaring!</i>" she gasped.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Jack Mainwaring&mdash;for it was indeed himself&mdash;looked at
his sister-in-law with a half-sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>He had no love for Lora's relations. He considered that
they had treated him badly. He was as well-born as they
were, and had been better off until Xenie had married the
old millionaire.</p>

<p>Yet they had flouted his love for Lora and refused to
sanction an engagement between them, hoping to send her
to the city and find a richer market for her beauty. So it
was with a smile of scorn he contemplated the agitation of
the beautiful young widow.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. St. John, it is Jack Mainwaring," he said,
grimly. "Don't be alarmed, I won't eat you."</p>

<p>Xenie regarded him with a stare of haughty amazement.</p>

<p>"I do not apprehend such a calamity," she said, icily.
"But&mdash;I thought you dead."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I have passed through some terrible
disasters, but luckily I escaped with my life. You will not
care to hear about that, though, so I will not digress. I
will say that I came up from the country this morning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
went down there yesterday to look for Lora. You will wonder,
perhaps, why I am here this morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll had sent the nurse away as soon as he entered.
They were alone, she and Xenie and the child, with
the handsome, desperate young man, looking as if he
hovered on the verge of madness.</p>

<p>He had not even spoken to his mother-in-law, who regarded
him with a species of terror.</p>

<p>Xenie fell back into her seat at the mention of Lora's
name. Her lip quivered and her eyes filled.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you surely have not come for Lora," she said,
and her voice was almost a moan of pain. "You surely
must have heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That <i>my wife</i> is dead," he said, and his voice shook so
that it was scarcely audible. "Yes, they told me she was
drowned. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she drowned herself," answered Xenie, in a low
tone of passionate despair.</p>

<p>She had not asked him to sit down, but Captain Mainwaring
dropped down heavily into a chair with a groan
of mortal agony, and hid his convulsed face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, <i>no</i>!" he cried out, wildly. "They did not
tell me that. It is not true. It cannot be true. She would
not have done that, my little Lora!"</p>

<p>"It is all your fault," cried out Mrs. Carroll, confronting
him with a pale face and flashing eyes. "You drove her
to it, Jack Mainwaring, you broke her heart. You killed her
as surely as if your hand had pushed her into that great,
cruel sea where she found her death!"</p>

<p>"She was my wife&mdash;I loved her," said the sailor in a voice
of anguish, as he lifted his wet eyes to the face of the angry
mother of his lost one. "<i>You</i> were the cruel one. You
denied her my love, and perhaps when you found out that
she belonged to me in spite of you, you tormented her to
death."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll did not answer him. She was afraid to speak.
A moment ago, in her rage and excitement, words had hovered
on her lips that would have betrayed the fact that a
child had been born to Lora.</p>

<p>But a quick telegraphic signal from her daughter arrested
the truth on her lips. So she remained silent, fearful that
some angry, unguarded word might betray Xenie's perilous
secret.</p>

<p>Meanwhile little Jack clung to Mrs. St. John's dress, and
regarded the big, handsome, bearded seaman with fearless,
fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly and Howard Templeton
stepped into the room, but no one saw him or heard him,
so intense was the excitement that pervaded their hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>He was about to advance toward Mrs. Carroll when he
saw Jack Mainwaring sitting in a position that screened the
new-comer from the ladies, while it exposed to full view his
own anguished and tear-wet face.</p>

<p>Howard paused instantly and stared at the handsome
sailor with increasing surprise each moment, until that expression
was succeeded by one of fervent pleasure.</p>

<p>He had known Jack Mainwaring quite well several years
before, and had been sincerely sorry when he had heard of
his loss at sea.</p>

<p>Now, after one puzzled moment, resulting from Jack's
long, glossy beard, he recognized him, and his heart leaped
with joy to think that Lora's husband was still numbered
among the living.</p>

<p>"But I did not come here to bandy words," continued
poor Jack, lifting his bowed head dejectedly. "Mrs. St.
John, will you tell me how long my wife has been dead?"</p>

<p>Xenie named the date in a half-choked voice. It was
fourteen months before.</p>

<p>Captain Mainwaring took a well-worn letter from his
pocket and ran over it again, while his manly face worked
convulsively with emotion; then he said, in a voice that
quivered with deep feeling:</p>

<p>"My poor Lora, my unfortunate wife, left me a child,
then. Where is that child, Mrs. St. John?"</p>

<p>A blank, terrified silence overwhelmed the two women.
Instinctively Xenie's arm crept around the child at her
knee and drew him closer to her side.</p>

<p>Captain Mainwaring had scarcely noticed little Jack before,
but Xenie's peculiar action attracted his attention.
He rose and took a step toward her.</p>

<p>"You do not answer me," he said. "Can it be, then, that
this is Lora's child and mine?"</p>

<p>Xenie caught the child up and held him tightly to her
breast, while she faced the speaker with wild, angry eyes,
like a lioness at bay.</p>

<p>"Back, back!" she cried, "do not touch him! This is
<i>my</i> child&mdash;mine, do you hear? How dare you claim him?"</p>

<p>"Yours, yours," cried the sailor, retreating before the
passionate vehemence of her voice and gestures; "I&mdash;I did
not know you had a child, madam."</p>

<p>"You did not," cried Xenie with breathless defiance.
"No matter. Ask mamma, there. Ask Doctor Shirley! Ask
anyone you choose. They will all tell you that this is my
child&mdash;<i>my</i> child, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Madam, I am not disputing your word," cried poor
Jack, in amaze at her angry vehemence. "Of course you
know best whose child it is. But will you tell me what became
of Lora's baby?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. St. John stared at him silently a moment, then she
answered, coldly:</p>

<p>"Lora's baby? Are you mad, Jack Mainwaring? Who
told you that she had a baby?"</p>

<p>His answer was a startling one:</p>

<p>"Lora told me so herself, Mrs. St. John."</p>

<p>Xenie St. John reeled backward a few steps, and stared
at the speaker with parted lips from which every vestige of
color had retreated, leaving them pallid and bloodless as a
ghost's.</p>

<p>"What, under Heaven, do you mean?" she inquired, in
a hollow voice.</p>

<p>Captain Mainwaring held up the letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"Do you see this letter?" he said. "It is the last one
Lora wrote me. I received it at the last port we touched
before our ship was burned. She begged me to come back
to her at once if I could, and save her name from the
shadow of disgrace. She told me that a child was coming
to us in the spring. I&mdash;oh, God, I was frantic! I meant to
return on the first homeward bound vessel! Then came
the terrible fire and loss of the vessel. Days and days we
floated on a raft&mdash;myself and three others&mdash;then we were
rescued by a merchant vessel bound for China. We had
to go there before we could come home. For months and
months I endured inconceivable tortures thinking of my
poor young wife's terrible strait. And after all&mdash;when I
thought I should so soon be at home and kiss her tears
away&mdash;I find her <i>dead</i>!"</p>

<p>His voice broke, he buried his face in his hands, and,
strong man though he was, sobbed aloud like a child.</p>

<p>They watched him, those four&mdash;Templeton, himself unseen&mdash;the
frightened mother and daughter, and the little
child with its sweet lips puckered grievingly at the man's
loud sobs.</p>

<p>But in a minute the man mastered himself, and went on
sadly:</p>

<p>"I was half frantic when I heard that my wife was dead.
But, after awhile, I remembered the little child. I said to
myself, I will go and seek it. If it be a little girl I will call
it Lora. It may comfort me a little for its mother's loss."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and looked at the pale, statue-like
woman before him.</p>

<p>"Where is the child?" he asked, almost plaintively.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell before his earnest gaze, her cheeks blanched
to the pallor of marble.</p>

<p>"She must have been mistaken," she faltered. "There
was no child."</p>

<p>The young sailor regarded her keenly.</p>

<p>"Madam, I do not believe you," he answered, bluntly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
"You are trying to deceive me. I ask you again, where
is my child? Is it dead? Was it drowned with its hapless
young mother?"'</p>

<p>"I tell you there was no child," she answered, defiantly,
stung to bitterest anger by his words.</p>

<p>"But there <i>was</i> a child," persisted Captain Mainwaring.
"Lora would not have deceived me."</p>

<p>"Not willfully, I know, but she was mistaken, I tell you,"
was the passionate response.</p>

<p>"I do not believe you, Mrs. St. John. You are trying to deceive
me for some purpose of your own. You kept my wife
from me, and you would fain keep my child, also. You have
hidden it away from me! Nay, I believe on my soul that
it is my child you hold in your arms and claim as your
own. Give it to me," he cried, advancing upon her.</p>

<p>But she retreated from him in terror.</p>

<p>"Never! never!" she cried out, in a passionate voice.</p>

<p>"Xenie, Xenie!" cried Howard Templeton, advancing
sternly, "do not stain your soul longer with such a horrible
falsehood. Give Jack Mainwaring the child! You well
know that it is his and Lora's own!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>Xenie St. John turned with a half-stifled shriek and
looked at the daring intruder.</p>

<p>She saw her enemy standing in the center of the room
looking down at her from his princely hight with a lightning
flash of scorn in his bright blue eyes, his lips set sternly
under his curling blonde mustache.</p>

<p>He was elegantly attired in the most fashionable morning
costume, and his fair, proud Saxon beauty had never appeared
more striking. Xenie's dark eyes flashed their gaze
into his blue ones with a blaze of passionate defiance.</p>

<p>"How dare you say so?" she cried, stamping her small,
slippered foot upon the rich carpet with angry vehemence.
"Are you mad, Howard Templeton?"</p>

<p>He stood still, folding his arms across his broad breast,
regarding her with a steady calmness strangely at variance
with her passionate vehemence.</p>

<p>"No, I am not mad," he answered, in low, even tones,
while his blue eyes gazed strangely into her own&mdash;"I am
not mad, and I dare assert nothing but what I know to be
the truth. So I repeat what I said to you just now. Give
Captain Mainwaring the innocent little child in whose name
you have perpetrated such a monstrous fraud. It is his child
and your sister's. I will prove it, and swear to it if necessary,
before any court in the land."</p>

<p>The calm and steady assurance of his words and looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and tones struck Xenie with inward terror. Yet it seemed
to her impossible that Howard Templeton could really know
the truth. Her heart quaked with terror, yet she tried to
brave it out in very desperation.</p>

<p>"How dare you say so?" she repeated, but her voice faltered,
and she trembled so that she could scarcely hold the
little child in her arms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll crept to her side and stood there dumbly,
filled with a yearning desire to help Xenie and shield her
from the consequences of her sin, but so horror-stricken
that she could not even speak.</p>

<p>Howard Templeton regarded Xenie with a look of scornful
amazement.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, in clear, ringing, vibrant tones, "I
can scarce believe that you will try to persist in this terrible
deception in the face of all that I have said. Listen, then,
and you shall know why I dare confront you with your
sin."</p>

<p>"Speak on," she answered, cresting her beautiful head
so defiantly, and looking at him so proudly that no one,
not even her mother, dreamed of the terrible pain that
ached at her heart.</p>

<p>"I have known of this deception from the first," he said.
"Ever since the evening I called upon your sister, before
you went to Europe. You personated Lora very cleverly.
I will give you that much credit; but you did not deceive
me five minutes. I saw through the mask directly, and
understood the daring game you were playing in furtherance
of your revenge against me. Your clever acting did
not blind me. I had loved you once, remember, and the
eyes of love are very keen."</p>

<p>Alternately flushing and paling, Xenie stared at him, still
clasping the little child to her wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>"Bah!" she cried out, contemptuously, as he paused;
"who would believe this wild tale that you are telling? If
you suspected me, why did you not speak out?"</p>

<p>"I had a fancy to see the farce played out," he answered,
coldly. "I was curious to know how far you would willfully
wander in the path of sin to gratify your thirst for
revenge. I followed you to Europe, although you did not
dream of such a thing until that wild and rainy dawn when
you met me on the shore near your cottage."</p>

<p>A groan forced itself though her pallid lips as she recalled
that dreadful day.</p>

<p>"But, Xenie," he continued, slowly, "I never meant to
let matters go as far as they have gone. It amused me for
a little while to watch your desperate game, but I always
intended to check you before you consummated your clever
plan. But that strange power that some call fate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
others Providence, has come between me and my first intention.
You have tasted the full sweetness of the cup
of revenge, and now you are doomed to drink the bitter
dregs. The disgraceful truth will all be known. The wealth
you have cheated me of by a terrible fraud will have to be
restored. The time has come when I cannot spare you if
I would."</p>

<p>She shivered as if an icy wind had blown against her, so
impressive were his looks and words; but she saw that
Captain Mainwaring was looking at her with mingled
wrath and scorn on his handsome, honest face; and the
spirit of defiance only grew stronger within her.</p>

<p>"I defy you," she began, imperiously, but the words
died half-uttered on her lips, and a shriek of fear and terror
burst forth instead.</p>

<p>For the closed door had opened silently and suddenly, and
a beautiful, fragile-looking woman had glided into the
room.</p>

<p>Xenie thought it was the ghost of her who lay in that
green grave under the skies of France, with the white
cross marked: "Lora, tat 18."</p>

<p>The beautiful intruder paused a moment and gazed questioningly
around her.</p>

<p>As if by magic, her gaze encountered that of the young
sea captain who was staring at her with wild, half-frightened
eyes, like one who sees a vision.</p>

<p>Lora&mdash;for it was indeed herself&mdash;gazed at the handsome
young sailor a moment in bewilderment; then a wild and
piercing shriek of joy burst from her lips. She rushed forward
and threw herself upon his broad breast in a transport
of happiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, Jack!" she cried, twining her white arms
tightly around his neck, "you are alive! What happiness
for your poor Lora!"</p>

<p>Captain Mainwaring clasped and kissed her with passionate
joy, understanding nothing very clearly except the
one ecstatic fact that Lora was indeed alive, and having
through his deep joy a vague consciousness that Mrs. St.
John had somehow terribly wronged and deceived him.</p>

<p>"You see," said Howard Templeton, coldly to Xenie as
she stared speechlessly. "Lora has returned to claim her
own. Your reign is over."</p>

<p>Lora heard the words, and breaking from the fond clasp
of her husband's arms, turned to her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, Xenie!" she cried, then she stopped short, and her
lovely face flushed and her dark eyes beamed.</p>

<p>She had caught sight of the beautiful boy that nestled in
the clasp of her sister's arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Lora watched him a moment with parted lips and eager
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she breathed, in tones of ineffable tenderness,
"how beautiful he is!" then, in low and almost humble
accents, she murmured: "Xenie, you will let me kiss him
once."</p>

<p>"It is Lora's voice and face," cried Mrs. St. John, half-retreating
before her as she advanced, "and yet I saw Lora
lying dead&mdash;drowned in the cruel sea!"</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Lora, eagerly, "that poor creature you
saw drowned was not your sister, Xenie."</p>

<p>"She wore your shawl, your rings," exclaimed Mrs. St.
John, incoherently.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," said Lora, patiently, "but I can easily
explain that, Xenie. She was a poor, mad creature that
I met in my wandering&mdash;even madder than myself, perhaps,
for I remember it all distinctly. She stripped me of
my shawl and my jewels&mdash;to make herself fine as she said.
I let her have them and she went away and left me. Then
it must have been that she cast herself into the sea. It was
she whom they found and whom you buried under the marble
cross with my name upon it. She was some poor, unknown
unfortunate whom you mourned as your sister."</p>

<p>She came closer to her sister's side as she spoke, and
looked up pleadingly into her face.</p>

<p>"Xenie, you will not disown me, will you? I am indeed
your sister, Lora, although you thought me dead. I owe
my life to Howard Templeton. He found me ill and dying
in a poor woman's cot, and cared for me and saved me.
Yes, at the very last hour, when they said I was dying, he
would not give me up. He brought a little baby and laid
it in my arms, and life came back to me at the touch of the
little lips and hands. He deceived me, but it was for my
own good. It saved my life, and when I grew stronger I
could bear to be told of the innocent deception he had practiced,
and I gave back the child to the kind peasant mother
who had lent it to me to save my life. But, oh, Xenie, if I
talked all day I could never tell you how much I owe to
Howard Templeton. He has been all that the best and
noblest brother on earth could be! You must not hate him
any longer. Xenie, you must forgive him and be kind to
him for my sake, since but for his tender care I must surely
have died."</p>

<p>As she ceased to speak, Jack Mainwaring strode forward
and caught Howard Templeton's hands in a grasp of steel.
Words failed him, but the tearful gaze of the honest eyes
was far more expressive of his gratitude than the most eloquent
speech.</p>

<p>But Xenie remained still and speechless. She suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Lora to kiss and caress her, but she remained still and pale,
seemingly incapable of a return of her sister's tenderness.
Her dark eyes stared straight before her, filled with a dumb
terror, as if some dread anticipation was painted on the walls
of her mind.</p>

<p>Slowly, like one fascinated, Lora crept nearer, and twining
her arms about her little child, kissed his sweet brow
and lips. Xenie turned mechanically and their eyes met.</p>

<p>They regarded each other silently a moment, but in
Lora's eyes there was a yearning tenderness, a plaintive
prayer that said plainer than words:</p>

<p>"Oh! my sister, give me my child. Let me lay him in
his father's arms, and say: 'My husband, this is my child
and yours.'"</p>

<p>The ice around Xenie's frozen heart melted at that wordless
prayer. Slowly she laid the beautiful, dark-eyed boy
in the yearning arms of the young mother.</p>

<p>"Take him, Lora," she said, "I absolve you from your
vow of silence. I cannot withhold this crowning joy that
will complete your happiness, although it wrecks my own.
Upon my head fall all the bitter consequences of my sin."</p>

<p>With the words she turned to leave the room, but that
bitter renunciation before her deadly foe had been too hard
for her.</p>

<p>She staggered blindly a moment, then fell to the floor like
one bereft of life.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>On the deck of a noble steamer outward bound, Lora
Mainwaring leaned upon her husband's arm and waved a
fond farewell to her mother and sister who watched her
tearfully from the shore.</p>

<p>Captain Mainwaring was about to make his first voyage
as the commander of the vessel, and his wife chose to go
with him, declaring that she feared the dangers of the sea
far less than the anguish of a second separation from her
husband.</p>

<p>Yet the tears stood thickly in her eyes as she clasped the
dimpled hand of her little son and watched those two sad
figures on the shore&mdash;the beloved mother and sister whom
she was leaving for long and weary months&mdash;and it might
be, for who could tell&mdash;perhaps forever!</p>

<p>Two months had passed since the eventful day when Lora
had returned to the dear ones who mourned her as dead&mdash;two
months of passionate happiness to her, yet crowded
with bitterness and humiliation to her beautiful and high-spirited
sister.</p>

<p>For yet again had the fabulous fortune of the old millionaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
changed hands, and Howard Templeton was victor
now.</p>

<p>Her passionate revenge, her perilous secret belonged to
the world now. It was as Howard had said. He could not
have spared her if he would, for Jack Mainwaring was
filled with rage and scorn at the knowledge that Xenie had
made his innocent child the instrument of a wicked revenge.</p>

<p>Passionate and impulsive, and hating his wife's relations
with cordial good will, Jack lost no time in spreading the
story to the winds.</p>

<p>The day came when a bitter impulse moved him to repentance,
but it was too late to undo his work.</p>

<p>"You were very wrong, Jack," little Lora said to him,
tearfully; "you should have remembered that it was not for
her sake alone my sister planned and carried out the deception.
She gained her revenge, but she also saved my
name from obloquy. When you rail so bitterly against
her, do not forget that I also lent myself to the deception in
my cowardly fear of the world's censure."</p>

<p>So Captain Mainwaring was slowly brought to take a
more reasonable view of the case. He apologized bluntly
but heartily to Xenie, and she forgave with him an almost
apathetic indifference.</p>

<p>For the beautiful and passionate woman was changed
now almost beyond belief. Even as she had hastened to be
revenged on Howard Templeton for her wrongs, she now
made haste to offer restitution. He had no need to contend
for his rights. Every dollar of which she had defrauded
him was now legally restored to him again.</p>

<p>And when that act of restitution was accomplished,
Xenie fell into strange and dangerous apathy. The idle
tongues of the world wagged busily, but she of whom they
gabbled remained secluded in her beautiful home, silent,
thoughtful, sufficient unto herself, heedless alike, it seemed,
of their praise or blame.</p>

<p>But the sorrowing mother who daily condemned herself
for her share in the trouble, as she anxiously watched her
daughter, saw that her delicate cheek was growing thin
and white, the brilliant lustre was fading from the mournful
black eyes, the musical voice had a subtle tone of
weariness. How could it be otherwise when she had lost so
much at one fell stroke of fate?</p>

<p>Fortune, revenge, the world's applause, even the little
child whom she had loved almost as her own, had slipped
from her clasp in an hour, and left her empty-handed on
the bleak shores of fate.</p>

<p>She did not know what to do with her blank and ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
life, and her empty heart whose idols all lay shattered in
the dust.</p>

<p>So she went her way in silence, not caring to look back,
not daring to look forward. For what was left to her now?
Nothing but life in a world that seemed to have ended for
her forever&mdash;life "more pathetic than death."</p>

<p>So, as she turned her dim eyes away from the gallant
ship that was bearing Lora so swiftly away from her native
land, she said in a voice that was sadder than tears:</p>

<p>"Let us go home, mother."</p>

<p>And while Lora went sailing away over the blue summer
sea, beneath the smiling sky of June, they turned their faces
homeward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Aunt Egerton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said the elegant woman of fashion, rising
with a rustling of silk and lace to greet her niece. "It is
I. I came early on purpose to go with you and see little
Lora off, but you were already gone. I would have followed
you, but they told me I should be too late. So I waited
for you here."</p>

<p>Then she rustled back to her seat again and there ensued
an embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>For this was the first time that Mrs. Egerton had crossed
the threshold since the story of Xenie's revenge and its ultimate
failure had become known to the carping world.</p>

<p>She, in common with the world, had been terribly shocked
by the disclosure, and had been in full accord with society
when it turned its back upon its whilom beautiful
favorite.</p>

<p>Now, as she sat there in the rich arm-chair of violet velvet,
with all the prestige of her rank and wealth about her,
she shrank uneasily before the half-veiled scorn in the beautiful,
dusky eyes of the woman who sat opposite regarding
her with a cold, inquiring glance.</p>

<p>Turning to her sister-in-law, Mrs. Carroll, she engaged
her in a little desultory chat while she recovered her self-possession.</p>

<p>"So Lora has gone on a voyage with her husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Carroll said, briefly.</p>

<p>She was silently wondering to herself what had brought
her proud sister-in-law to Xenie's house after she had, in the
world's parlance, so completely "cut" her.</p>

<p>"Is she quite happy?" continued Mrs. Egerton, patronizingly.</p>

<p>She had a private opinion that no one could be happy in
such a misalliance as Lora had made, but she forbore to air
her secret views for the benefit of her auditors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lora is perfectly happy, I believe," was the confident
answer.</p>

<p>"Ah, I am very glad. Her story has been as romantic
as a novel. I am pleased to hear that it has ended in the
same happy fashion."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Mrs. St. John.</p>

<p>"Xenie, I expect you were surprised to find me here this
morning. You must have thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused here, a little disconcerted by the steady fire
of the proud, dark eyes that gravely regarded her.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," she resumed in a moment, with a little laugh,
"I have been sadly vexed with you, Xenie. Who could
help it? I had been so proud of you, and hoped such great
things for you, I could hardly bear it when I learned to
what length your passion had carried you."</p>

<p>She paused in sheer pity as she saw the blush of shame
flashing suddenly into those white cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," she continued, with a significant
smile. "All is not lost yet. We will not recall the past.
But I wish to talk to your mother. Won't you gather a
bunch of your beautiful roses for me, dear, while we have
our little chat?"</p>

<p>Glad of an excuse for leaving the room, Xenie turned
away, followed by a smile of blended triumph and cunning
from her maneuvering aunt.</p>

<p>She ran down the marble steps at one side of the house
that led into the beautiful rose-garden that lay glowing
and blushing under the balmy sky of June.</p>

<p>Running down the graveled path, she stopped short very
suddenly, and a low cry escaped her lips:</p>

<p>"Howard Templeton!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>A gentleman, standing alone beside a marble fountain,
turns with a start and looks at her. His face is handsome,
eager, agitated.</p>

<p>"Mrs. St. John," he says; then a strange constraint seems
to fall upon both. They remain standing still and regarding
each other in painful silence.</p>

<p>It is the first time they have met since the day of her terrible
humiliation, more than two months ago. In the passionate
war they waged he had been the victor. One would
think that he would meet her now with words of exultation.</p>

<p>Yet he is silent, and a dark-red flush creeps slowly up his
temples, while his handsome blue eyes regard her with a
strange intentness.</p>

<p>To the day of his death he remembers her as she looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
now. Not the expression of a feature, not a fold of her
robe escapes his memory.</p>

<p>She looks like some beautiful, pale statue.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gown'd in pure white that fitted to the shape&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A single stream of all her soft, dark curls<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pour'd on one side."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sunshine beams upon her lovingly. A creeping rose-tree
throws out its briery arms as though it would fain
draw her into its thorny embrace. The light breeze scatters
the scented rose-petals in a shower of sweetness under
her feet. A happy bird warbles its lay of love above her
drooping head.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turns to go, thrilled with a bitter pang of
remembrance.</p>

<p>The movement breaks the spell that binds him. He
springs after her.</p>

<p>"Do not go," he exclaims, in a voice of unconscious
pleading.</p>

<p>"Why should I stay?" she asks, turning her proud, dark
eyes upon him. "Why have you intruded your unwelcome
presence upon me?"</p>

<p>The flush on his fair, handsome face deepens.</p>

<p>"Xenie, pardon the <i>ruse</i> by which I have gained admittance
to your presence," he exclaims. "I wished to see
you and I went to Mrs. Egerton, and stating my reasons,
begged her to arrange this meeting."</p>

<p>"Did you not know that the very sight of you is hateful
in my eyes?" she demands, spiritedly.</p>

<p>"I feared so," he answers, with an unconscious tone of
sadness in his voice. "Yet I wished to see you. There is
something I have to tell you."</p>

<p>"You can tell me nothing that I wish to hear," she retorts,
haughtily. "Let me pass, sir. I refuse to listen!"</p>

<p>But the tall, handsome form blocks her way, and shows
no signs of yielding.</p>

<p>"Stay, one moment, Xenie," he exclaims. "Suppose I
tell you that your vengeance is secure after all&mdash;that Uncle
John's missing will is found at last?"</p>

<p>She whirls toward him, her dark eyes blazing with incredulous
surprise.</p>

<p>"At last!" she says, with a stifled gasp. "At last! And
who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I found it," he answers, not waiting for her to finish the
incoherent question. "He had hidden it, I cannot imagine
why, in the most unlikely place in the world. By the
merest accident I came upon it yesterday. Take it, Xenie.
It secures your revenge to you now, beyond the shadow of
a doubt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew an official-looking document from his breast and
placed it in her shaking hand. She holds it in a mechanical
grasp, her dark, wondering eyes lifted to his proud, agitated
face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeats, slowly, "your vengeance is now secure.
Every penny of my Uncle John's vast wealth is bequeathed
to you in the legal document you hold in your
hand. I am left utterly penniless!"</p>

<p>But instead of the triumphant joy he expects to see in her
mobile face, her look of wonder deepens.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> found the will&mdash;<i>you</i> brought it to me," she says,
with slow gravity. "Who knows of it besides yourself?"</p>

<p>"No one except your aunt, Mrs. Egerton," he answers,
calmly; "I have told her, and she is very anxious to congratulate
you."</p>

<p>Her red lips curl with faint scorn. But she does not
speak. This sudden turn of fortune's wheel seems to have
dazed her. She stands quite still holding the precious paper
in her tightly-clasped hand, while her dark eyes fix themselves
upon it in a strange, intent fashion.</p>

<p>She has lost her revenge, she has lost the world's applause,
but this little bit of yellow paper is able to buy it all back
for her. It seems too stupendous to believe.</p>

<p>"Why have you done this thing?" she asks, rousing herself,
and lifting a curious glance to the silent man before
her.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," he begins, half-haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, you do," she interrupts him quickly. "When
you found this will, which leaves you penniless, and me,
your enemy, triumphant, you must have been tempted to
destroy it. You knew that I had resorted to a fraud in
order to gain my revenge. How did you conquer the temptation
to repay me likewise? Were you nobler than I that
you did not burn this paper and keep your uncle's wealth?"</p>

<p>"Xenie, if you will answer me one simple question, I will
tell you why I beat down the temptation to keep the wealth
which has caused us both so many a bitter heart-ache," he
said to her, in a grave, sad voice.</p>

<p>"I will answer you," she repeated, slowly.</p>

<p>"Tell me this, then, Xenie. In the hour when the result
of your hopes and plans became known to you&mdash;when you
thought you had fully secured the revenge for which you
had toiled&mdash;did your success make you happy?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, in low but steady tones, while her
whole frame quivered with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"No," he re-echoed; "revenge has not in it the elements
of happiness. It is but a consuming fire that destroys
everything sweet and lovely. We both have proved it;
therefore, Xenie, I will have no more to do with it. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
repented in bitterness of spirit the deadly feud we waged so
long against each other. The only atonement that was left
to me you hold in your hand."</p>

<p>"It was a brave atonement when you remember all that
it involves for you," she cried, with a sudden remorseful
pity in her voice. "You have been nobler than I have."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was only selfish after all," he answered, impulsively;
"for, Xenie, I have been very unhappy in your
unhappiness. Every arrow that was pointed at your heart
has pierced mine. I have long ago realized that, no matter
how terrible the loss to myself, I could never be happy save
in the ultimate triumph of the woman I love."</p>

<p>"Love!" she echoed, looking at him with a wondering,
startled gaze.</p>

<p>The blue eyes met hers, full of mad, hopeless passion, so
long repressed and beaten down that now it seemed a consuming
flame.</p>

<p>"Yes, love," he answered, recklessly. "Forgive me,
Xenie, but let me speak one moment. Do you think I have
forgotten those brief, bright days when we loved each other?
Do you think I can ever forget them? I have never ceased
to love you; I never shall until this beating heart is dust
and ashes! I count that one bright memory of our mutual
love worth all its bitter cost!"</p>

<p>The burning crimson flashed into her cheeks. Did he
mean it&mdash;all that those impetuous words implied?</p>

<p>"You cannot fool me with empty words," she cried.
"Do I not know better? Could my love be so much to you
when you threw it away for&mdash;for this that I hold in my
hand?" and she threw a glance of scorn upon the paper in
her grasp that represented all the vast wealth of the old
millionaire.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then the pent-up heart of
the man broke out into passionate words; the bird in the
bough overhead hushed its song and seemed to listen.</p>

<p>"Xenie, Xenie, my love and lost darling, why will you
wrong me so? Oh, my God! how little I weighed that filthy
lucre against your love! I swear to you here, under this
blue heaven, and in this hour when I never expect to behold
your beautiful face again, that I broke our troth alone because
I loved with too dear a passion to doom you to the ills
of poverty for my sake. I love you, Xenie, deeply, fondly,
devotedly, and I gloried in the thought of lavishing wealth
upon you; and when my uncle bade me resign you I gave
up my hope&mdash;not because I was afraid to brave poverty <i>for</i>
you, but because I dared not face it <i>with</i> you. Darling,
how could I bear to doom you, my tender flower, to the
ills of poverty and want? But, there, I have told you all
this before, and you would not believe it. Why should I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
weary you again? It is only because I am leaving you forever
that I have yielded to the weakness. Farewell, Xenie,
and may God bless you!"</p>

<p>He ceased, and in the solitude and stillness of the odorous
rose garden it seemed to him as if she must hear his
heart beating, so loud and fast were its throbs of anguish.
But she was silent, and he turned to go.</p>

<p>"Howard, stay," she murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps to her side.</p>

<p>"Xenie, what are you doing?" he cried in horror; for
she had taken the millionaire's will between her white and
jeweled fingers and was tearing it swiftly into the smallest
fragments.</p>

<p>The tiny white bits were flying from her hands like a
miniature snow-storm.</p>

<p>She laughed lightly at his look of horror.</p>

<p>"John St. John never meant me to have all his money,"
she answered. "I coerced him into making this will, and
he hid it then, hoping, no doubt, that it would never be
found. There is an end of it. Let all remain as it was before.
You have your share and I mine."</p>

<p>"And your revenge?" he asked, looking at her as if he
doubted his own sanity.</p>

<p>"Never speak of it again," she answered, turning from
him, while the crimson blush of shame overspread her face.</p>

<p>A wild hope, undreamed of before, darted into his mind.
He caught her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Xenie, why have you done this thing?" he asked.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes lifted to his, full of a noble repentance.</p>

<p>"Because I love you," she answered, "and I cannot war
against you any longer. Forgive me, Howard; it was
never hatred that wrought my sin; it was the cruel madness
of love."</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms with a low cry of passionate
thanksgiving, and the little birds, listening in the nests
above their heads, heard the sound of kisses and passionate
words, mixed with a woman's happy sobs.</p>

<p>"Xenie," he said, presently, when her sobs grew calmer,
"they told me that Lord Dudley had sued for your hand,
and that you had promised to return to England with him
as his bride. You cannot imagine what I suffered when I
heard it. Even while I thought you hated me I could never
feel indifferent to you, though I tried hard to put you out
of my heart."</p>

<p>"Lord Dudley asked me," she whispered back. "He
was very noble. He knew all my story, but he judged me
very gently, and he would have given me his name and
love, but I told him it might never be&mdash;that I had loved
but one in my life, and that I could never love another."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>He pressed a dozen kisses on the sweet red lips that whispered the fond
confession.</p>

<p>"And you forgive me everything, do you, Howard?" she questioned,
gravely. "You know that I have sinned very grievously. I have almost
periled my soul in my mad rage for an unholy revenge."</p>

<p>"May God forgive you as freely as I do, my darling," he answered,
fondly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When they strolled into the drawing-room arm-in-arm, a little later,
Mrs. Egerton rose from her arm-chair, rustling more than ever in her
happy self-importance.</p>

<p>"My dear Xenie," she simpered, "let me be the first to congratulate
you that your husband's missing will is found at last."</p>

<p>For answer, Xenie drew her to the window.</p>

<p>"Aunt Egerton, I forgot your bunch of roses," she said, "but I want
you to look down there in that graveled walk."</p>

<p>She pointed to the tiny fragments of paper, and Mrs. Egerton's face
grew pale.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, uneasily.</p>

<p>"It is St. John's will," Xenie answered steadily, yet crimsoning painfully
beneath her aunt's curious glance.</p>

<p>"And you have destroyed it," Mrs. Egerton exclaimed. "Were you
mad, child?"</p>

<p>Xenie looked at her aunt with a gesture of proud humility.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I have been mad, but, thank God I have come
to my senses at last. I destroyed the will because I had wronged Howard
enough already without taking his inheritance from him. I have confessed
my faults to him and he has forgiven everything."</p>

<p>"And the long vendetta is over," said Mrs. Egerton. "Henceforth you
will be&mdash;&mdash;" she paused for a suitable word.</p>

<p>"Xenie will be my wife," said Howard Templeton, drawing near.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carroll, who had been silent all this while, drew near and took
her daughter for one moment into the tender clasp of her maternal
arms.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my daughter," she murmured. "You have known
deep sorrow&mdash;may your future years be very happy ones."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My readers, we close our story as we began it&mdash;with a wedding. But
this time the wedding bells indeed are "golden bells," ringing out the
mellow chimes of true happiness.</p>

<p>For this is not the union of winter and summer, this is not the sordid
barter of youth and beauty for an old man's gold. It is that one true
and beautiful union upon earth where the solemn vow of marriage welds
eternally together</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
